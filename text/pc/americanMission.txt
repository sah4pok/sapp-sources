The date went well! Now she wants a lift back to her place...

[GF_0009]
She seems happy enough. Now give her a run home!

[GF_0010]
She likes you! Next time she might go a little further...

She doesn't sound too pissed - she must have such low self esteem!

[GF_0069]
Time to park up and get to first base!
