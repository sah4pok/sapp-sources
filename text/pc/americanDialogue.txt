[MSWE08B]
~z~CJ, I been thinking.

[MSWE08C]
~z~The city's big, but it ain't that big.

[MSWE08D]
~z~Some fools know where Smoke's hiding.

[MSWE08E]
~z~but as long as the Grove Street Families don't rule the streets,

[MSWE08F]
~z~his money is going to mean more than our rep.

[MSWE08G]
~z~What you got in mind?

[MSWE08H]
~z~We gotta hit those Ballas and Vagos with everything,

[MSWE08J]
~z~Hit every neighborhood they got!

[MSWE08K]
~z~If that's the only way, I'm down for that!

[MSWE08L]
~z~I'm gonna see what I can find out on the streets.

[MSWE08N]

[MSWE10F]
~z~Grove Street Families ain't big no more.

[MSWE10G]
~z~Seville Boulevard Families and Temple Drive Families are beefing, and split with the Grove.

[MSWE10H]
~z~Now we so busy set tripping, Ballas and Vagos have taken over, so watch yo'self out there.

[MSWE10J]
~z~Just because they're wearing greens, don't mean they're allies. Copy?

[MSWE10K]
~z~Yeah, I hear you.

[MSWE10L]
~z~Thanks for the heads up.

[MSWE10N]
~z~Don't mention it.

[MHEL_1E]
~z~Chums? Girl you gotta get out more!

[MHEL_1F]
~z~Well if the option is getting out with you or shooting my own leg off, I'm reaching for the gun!

[MHEL_1G]
~z~Look, Helena, girl c'mon!

[MHEL_1H]

~z~Hey Carl, just called to say that last night was terrific.

[MMILL2C]

[MMILL2D]
~z~Listen, I thought about that little scheme you told me about.

[MMILL2E]
~z~Don't worry, I haven't told anybody, not even my mom.

[MMILL2F]
~z~I've left the key card and the door code in my bedroom.

[MMILL2G]
~z~I'm going out of town for a while, so you can make it look like a burglary.

[MMILL2H]
~z~Millie, girl, you will NOT regret this!

[MMILL2J]
~z~I know, because I'm getting a cut, right?

[MMILL2K]
~z~Sure thing, Millie, sure thing. I'll see you right.

[MMILL2L]
~z~OK, you got it.

[MJET_1A]
~z~Yeah, what?

[MJET_1B]
~z~Yo, man, it's Jethro, dude!

[MJET_1C]
~z~Hey Jethro, whattup?

[MJET_1D]
~z~Well, I was talking to Cesar, and uh, well don't get me wrong, dude,

[MJET_1E]
~z~I mean, you are one out there dude, when it comes to driving, man,

[MJET_1F]
~z~but Cesar, he told us how many cars you get through, dude,

[MJET_1G]
~z~and me and Dwaine were, like, whooaaa!

[MJET_1H]
~z~What is your point, Jethro?

[MJET_1J]
~z~No point, man, no point!

[MJET_1K]
~z~Just that there's an advanced driving school, like,

[MJET_1L]
~z~just up the road from the garage, man, like in Doherty.

[MJET_1M]
~z~Driving school? Man, exactly what you trying to say, man?

[MJET_1N]
~z~NOTHING, man! Nothing. It was Dwaine's idea.

[MJET_1O]
~z~I think you're, like, y'know, cool and shit.

[MJET_1P]
~z~I better go, CJ, I'll see you later.

[MJET_2A]
~z~Yo, CJ, it's, like, Jethro, dude!

[MJET_2B]
~z~Hey Jethro, how is it?

[MJET_2C]
~z~Yo, dude, the garage is coming along nicely, man.

[MJET_2D]
~z~But I rang about something else.

[MJET_2E]
~z~There's an unofficial street racing club in San Fierro.

[MJET_2F]
~z~Unofficial, as in 'illegal', right?

[MJET_2G]
~z~I don't know what you're talking about, dude.

[MJET_2H]
~z~Anyhoo, they meet up around the driving school someplace.

[MJET_2J]
~z~Thought you might, y'know, like to know.

[MJET_2K]
~z~Thanks, Jethro. I'm a think about it, and I'll holla at you.

[MJET_2L]
~z~Later, man.

[MJET_3A]
~z~Hello!

[MJET_3B]
~z~Yo, it's Jethro, man.

[MJET_3C]
~z~Listen, me an' Cesar have used our contacts to, like, get a wish list of cars,

[MJET_3D]
~z~but we'll need to turn them around real quick, dude.

[MJET_3E]
~z~Now there's a showroom round the block that's come up for sale

[MJET_3F]
~z~and I thought it would be a good idea to make things look as legitimate as possible.

[MJET_3G]
~z~Yeah, that's a great idea man, I'm a look in to it.

[MJET_3H]
~z~I'm a holla at you.

[MSWE06O]

~z~Gonna have to let this one slide, man, got too much shit on my plate.

[MCES08E]
~z~Aw shit, I'm tied up right now. We're gonna have to get 'em next time, dude.

[SHRK_1A]
~z~Hey, Mr. Johnson. Just a friendly reminder that you owe me money.

[SHRK_1B]
~z~Don't be a stranger.

[SHRK_2A]
~z~Hello, Carl Johnson.

[SHRK_2B]
~z~You owe me money and I would consider it polite if you paid it back, understand?

[SHRK_3A]
~z~Mr. Carl Johnson. My records show that you owe me money.

[SHRK_3B]
~z~Probably just slipped your mind, but I thought I'd just jog your memory.

[SHRK_4A]
~z~Mr. Johnson! I haven't seen you for a while, and you owe me money!

[SHRK_4B]
~z~Consider your position and that of your friends and family!

[SHRK_5A]
~z~Carl! I hope you're not spending too much cash. Especially since you've owed me money for so long.

[SHRK_5B]
~z~Don't make an enemy of me, Carl.

[SHRK_6A]
~z~Carl Johnson. I hear you have a sister.

[SHRK_6B]
~z~Don't make me explain to her why you owe me so much money!

[SHRK_7A]
~z~I'm a patient man, Mr. Johnson, but I'm also a businessman, understand?

[SHRK_7B]
~z~You owe me money, Carl, think about it.

[SHRK_8A]
~z~Mr. Johnson, you owe me money.

[SHRK_8B]
~z~A business relationship is built on trust and mutual respect. Think about it.

[SHRK_9A]
~z~Mr. Johnson, I hear you're in the neighborhood!

[SHRK_9B]
~z~Some of my associates will be paying you a visit to talk about your debts.

[SHRK10A]
~z~Carl Johnson. Little bird told me you're in town.

[SHRK10B]
~z~You should have listened to me and paid your debts.

[SHRK11A]
~z~A man of honor pays his debts, Mr. Johnson.

[SHRK11B]
~z~You've left me no choice but to treat you with the same lack of respect you've shown me.

[SHRK12A]
~z~I am not a charity, Mr. Johnson, I'm a businessman.

[SHRK12B]
~z~You should have paid up while you had the chance.

[SHRK13A]
~z~Mr. Johnson, I want my fucking money!

[SHRK13B]
~z~I'm sending someone round to pay you a little courtesy call.

[SHRK14A]
~z~I don't think you're getting the message, Mr. Johnson: I WANT MY MONEY!

[SHRK14B]
~z~I'll let you negotiate with my, eh, collection department.

[SHRK15A]
~z~The time for pleasantries is past, Mr. Johnson.

[SHRK15B]
~z~You've given me no choice but to get a little more persuasive about your debt problems.

[SHRK16A]
~z~You had your chance to pay me, Mr. Johnson.

[SHRK16B]
~z~You've left me no option in this matter - I WANT MY MONEY!

[LOC3_JA]
~z~Congratulations on your award, you must be thrilled!

[LOC3_JB]
~z~Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'd like to thank my fans, my momma and my dealer.

[SYN2_LO]
~z~Yeah, go on.

[ROT4_ZC]
~z~Carl, you motherfucking piece of shit gang-banging cocksucker!

[RYDX_AA]
~z~Hop in, CJ.

[RYDX_AB]
~z~Jump in.

[RYDX_AD]
~z~All aboard, CJ.

[RYDX_AE]
~z~Guess you drivin, huh?

[RYDX_AF]
~z~C'mon CJ, earn your keep!

[RYDX_AG]
~z~I'm tripping man, you drive.

[SWEX_BS]
~z~CJ, for once, don't be a punk!

[SWEX_BP]
~z~Don't be a buster, CJ!

[DES8_LD]
~z~Aw shit, you hippy asshole!

[SWEX_AH]
~z~Get us back to the hood, CJ!

[MHRZ01A]
~z~Carl, it's officer Hernandez

[MHRZ01B]
~z~Who?

[MHRZ01C]
~z~Officer Hernandez.

[MHRZ01D]
~z~I work with Tenpenny and Pulaski.

[MHRZ01E]
~z~Oh, the bitch, what the hell you want?

[MHRZ01F]
~z~Hey, show me some respect, boy.

[MHRZ01G]
~z~Go fuck yourself, you just they bitch!

[MHRZ01H]
~z~You watch your tone, boy.

[MHRZ01J]
~z~Now listen. I've got a message from Officer Tenpenny.

[MHRZ01K]
~z~Don't try and leave town, that would be a big mistake.

[MHRZ01L]
~z~You hear me?

[MHRZ01M]
~z~We're watching you.

[MHRZ01N]
~z~Whatever you say, bitch.

{=================================== MISSION TABLE BCESAR2 ===================================}

[BCE2@00:BCESAR2]
~z~Hey Carl.

[BCE2@01:BCESAR2]
~z~How you doin' sis?

[BCE2@02:BCESAR2]
~z~Better. Thank you. You came through for me.

[BCE2@03:BCESAR2]
~z~This ain't over, man. I did this to take care of my woman.

[BCE2@04:BCESAR2]
~z~But now I'm gonna head straight back home,

[BCE2@05:BCESAR2]
~z~and I'm gonna cap me some fucking dope dealers!

[BCE2@06:BCESAR2]
~z~Hey look, you go into the barrio with that big willy bullshit,

[BCE2@07:BCESAR2]
~z~and you gonna get shredded.

[BCE2@08:BCESAR2]
~z~And I ain't losing you over no macho bullshit!

[BCE2@09:BCESAR2]
~z~Hey, relax, man.

[BCE2@10:BCESAR2]
~z~It's gonna get handled when it's time.

[BCE2@11:BCESAR2]
~z~We already know who the fucking bad guys are, man,

[BCE2@12:BCESAR2]
~z~your stinking Grove Street brother Smoke,

[BCE2@13:BCESAR2]
~z~and those chota pigs Tenpenny and Pulaski!

[BCE2@14:BCESAR2]
~z~Smoke, he's a pusher, man!

[BCE2@15:BCESAR2]
~z~No, no, not Smoke, he might mess with C.R.A.S.H,

[BCE2@16:BCESAR2]
~z~but he don't mess with no yay.

[BCE2@17:BCESAR2]
~z~Come on, CJ! How you think he got that new house, huh?

[BCE2@18:BCESAR2]
~z~Just let that Grove-for-life bullshit go and take a look around you.

[BCE2@19:BCESAR2]
~z~Word on the street is twice a week,

[BCE2@20:BCESAR2]
~z~Smoke sends a car out to San Fierro,

[BCE2@21:BCESAR2]
~z~and the trunk comes back full of white.

[BCE2@22:BCESAR2]
~z~Shit. I gotta keep my eye on the highway to San Fierro.

[BCE2@23:BCESAR2]
~z~Maybe I'll see something.

[BCE2@24:BCESAR2]
~z~Just... Just lay low and I'll be back.

{=================================== MISSION TABLE BCESAR4 ===================================}

[BCE4@00:BCESAR4]
~z~Hey, I've been waiting forever, man. Where the hell you been?

[BCE4@01:BCESAR4]
~z~Sorry, holmes, I had no idea when the race would be.

[BCE4@02:BCESAR4]
~z~Riiight - you just happened to show up

[BCE4@03:BCESAR4]
~z~five minutes after everybody else, huh?

[BCE4@04:BCESAR4]
~z~When the gasoline runs through your veins like the burning passion,

[BCE4@05:BCESAR4]
~z~you know when it's time to race!

[BCE4@06:BCESAR4]
~z~I think you're getting high on that country air, man!

[BCE4@07:BCESAR4]
~z~Hey, CJ, look...

[BCE4@08:BCESAR4]
~z~You haven't been to one of our meets before,

[BCE4@09:BCESAR4]
~z~where you from, friend?

[BCE4@10:BCESAR4]
~z~I'm from Grove Street Families, Los Santos. What's happening?

[BCE4@11:BCESAR4]
~z~Relax. This isn't a parade, pal. But, you know, we gotta be careful.

[BCE4@12:BCESAR4]
~z~Wu Zi Mu, but my friends call me 'Woozie'. How you doing?

[BCE4@13:BCESAR4]
~z~Wha..? CJ. Carl Johnson.

[BCE4@14:BCESAR4]
~z~Listen, out here we like to race for cash or pink slips - racer's choice.

[BCE4@15:BCESAR4]
~z~Get your car started, we're about to go. Good luck, Carl Johnson.

[BCE4@16:BCESAR4]
~z~Be careful CJ!

[BCE4@17:BCESAR4]
~z~There's something real strange about that dude, man.

[BCE4W00:BCESAR4]
~z~You drive with style, Carl Johnson -

[BCE4W01:BCESAR4]
~z~and I never mind losing to a guy who's willing to push himself right to the edge.

[BCE4W02:BCESAR4]
~z~As for me, I'm a man who honors his bet.

[BCE4W03:BCESAR4]
~z~Well, you learn pretty fast with the police on your ass.

[BCE4W04:BCESAR4]
~z~Listen, it's best if we clear the hell out of here as soon as possible

[BCE4W05:BCESAR4]
~z~because, for some reason, the local police don't appreciate our noble sport.

[BCE4W06:BCESAR4]
~z~Yeah. Thanks for the advice.

[BCE4W07:BCESAR4]
~z~OK, I gotta go.

[BCE4W08:BCESAR4]
~z~Uh, you know what? If you ever find yourself in San Fierro, give me a call,

[BCE4W09:BCESAR4]
~z~maybe we can do a little business together.

[BCE4W10:BCESAR4]
~z~Yeah, I might just do that.

[BCE4W11:BCESAR4]
~z~I guess that's our wake up call. Nice meeting you.

[BCE5@00:BCESAR4]
~z~Damn, man, now what?

[BCE5@01:BCESAR4]
~z~PIG!

[BCE5@02:BCESAR4]
~z~What? What'd I do now?

[BCE5@03:BCESAR4]
~z~Oh, so THIS is where you been, eh?

[BCE5@04:BCESAR4]
~z~THIS is how you repay my tenderness!

[BCE5@05:BCESAR4]
~z~You prefer the curves of some car to those of a real woman?

[BCE5@06:BCESAR4]
~z~Look, Catalina, you called it off, remember, 'just business'.

[BCE5@07:BCESAR4]
~z~What kind of a man are you?

[BCE5@08:BCESAR4]
~z~When I say 'just business', I mean that I love you!

[BCE5@09:BCESAR4]
~z~When I say, I no interested no more, I mean that I long for you!

[BCE5@10:BCESAR4]
~z~Wait, Catalina, wait! Leave my car alone,

[BCE5@11:BCESAR4]
~z~I did this for us, for me and you!

[BCE5@12:BCESAR4]
~z~It's too late. I don't love you no more. I love another, OK?

[BCE5@13:BCESAR4]
~z~What?

[BCE5@14:BCESAR4]
~z~Then what the fuck was this about?

[BCE5@15:BCESAR4]
~z~I cannot keep my passions holed up, they need a release.

[BCE5@16:BCESAR4]
~z~That was a good release,

[BCE5@17:BCESAR4]
~z~like hitting a man with a frying pan while he sleeps.

[BCE5@18:BCESAR4]
~z~This, CARL, THIS is my new man.

[BCE5@19:BCESAR4]
~z~Are you jealous? Are you going to fight for me?

[BCE5@20:BCESAR4]
~z~No, no, I can take rejection.

[BCE5@21:BCESAR4]
~z~You are jealous and a coward!

[BCE5@22:BCESAR4]
~z~Now let's race!

[BCE5@23:BCESAR4]
~z~Crazy bitch.

[BCE5W00:BCESAR4]
~z~You had the unfair advantage!

[BCE5W01:BCESAR4]
~z~Being a better driver ain't no unfair advantage.

[BCE5W02:BCESAR4]
~z~You think you're clever, but it is you who is missing the point!

[BCE5W03:BCESAR4]
~z~Not only was he racing, but he was satisfying me, fully!

[BCE5W04:BCESAR4]
~z~The advantage of a stick shift, I guess.

[BCE5W05:BCESAR4]
~z~Yeah whatever, anyway, man, what is it, cash or pink slip?

[BCE5W06:BCESAR4]
~z~There you go!

[BCE5W07:BCESAR4]
~z~Goodbye Mr. Johnson, I will NOT be missing you!

[BCE5W08:BCESAR4]
~z~Hey, wait a minute, bitch! What is this shit?

[BCE5W09:BCESAR4]
~z~The deed to a garage in San Fierro.

[BCE5W10:BCESAR4]
~z~My lover needs his car so we can go to Liberty City.

[BCE5W11:BCESAR4]
~z~Liberty City? Yeah, whatever, have a good time.

[BCE5W12:BCESAR4]
~z~I will.

[BCE5W13:BCESAR4]
~z~Fine.

[BCE5W14:BCESAR4]
~z~OK.

[BCE5W15:BCESAR4]
~z~GOODBYE!

[BCS5_AA:BCESAR4]
~z~Oh, Claude, you're so big and manful!

[BCS5_AB:BCESAR4]
~z~Claude, you're the best driver I've ever bedded!

[BCS5_AC:BCESAR4]
~z~Hands on the wheel, Claude, hands on the wheel!

[BCS5_AD:BCESAR4]
~z~Oh Claude, it's bigger than the gear stick!

[BCS5_AE:BCESAR4]
~z~I have never felt so satisfied!

[BCS5_AF:BCESAR4]
~z~Five orgasms in as many minutes!

[BCS5_AG:BCESAR4]
~z~Marry me, Claude, marry me!

[BCS5_AH:BCESAR4]
~z~Oh Claude, I don't know if I'm woman enough!

[BCS5_BA:BCESAR4]
~z~Hey, Carl, you drive like a drunken camel!

[BCS5_BB:BCESAR4]
~z~Carl, are you jealous, heh?

[BCS5_BC:BCESAR4]
~z~Claude has such girth, he is AMAZING!

[BCS5_BD:BCESAR4]
~z~Claude would make you feel inadequate!

[BCS5_BE:BCESAR4]
~z~At last I have found a man to satisfy me!

[BCS5_BF:BCESAR4]
~z~Claude is so manful, so FORCEFUL!

[BCS5_BG:BCESAR4]
~z~I never knew there was so much MORE to sex!

[BCE4@18:BCESAR4]
~z~Man, where is this guy?

[BCE4@19:BCESAR4]
~z~For sure, man.

[BCE4W12:BCESAR4]
~z~Oooh, yeah!

[BCE5@24:BCESAR4]
~z~What the fuck?

[BCE5@25:BCESAR4]
~z~Wait! Hey, that's my...

[BCE5@26:BCESAR4]
~z~And when I said that I missed you..!

~z~What's going on?

[BCR1@03:BCRASH1]
~z~You got a bag over your head, boy. How you feel about that?

[BCR1@04:BCRASH1]
~z~Man, take it off. Please, man, I can't breathe! Please!

[BCR1@05:BCRASH1]
~z~Oh, alright. But only because you said please.

[BCR1@06:BCRASH1]
~z~You fucking sick motherfucker!

[BCR1@07:BCRASH1]
~z~Intimidate those who intimidate others, Carl. It's my job.

[BCR1@08:BCRASH1]
~z~Hey, man, where we at?

[BCR1@11:BCRASH1]
~z~Sweet is alive.

[BCR1@12:BCRASH1]
~z~Alive and inside. He's in a prison hospital being treated for gunshot wounds, awaiting trial.

[BCR1@13:BCRASH1]
~z~Yeah, somehow, nobody's caught you yet.

[BCR1@14:BCRASH1]
~z~We've done you a big favor.

[BCR1@15:BCRASH1]
~z~Oh yeah, you should be glad, Carl. Your moron brother's alive.

[BCR1@16:BCRASH1]
~z~Your street trash, soon to be turned out sister's alive.

[BCR1@17:BCRASH1]
~z~And, she's only sucking one greaseball's dick.

[BCR1@18:BCRASH1]
~z~Things are going pretty well for you, Carl.

[BCR1@19:BCRASH1]
~z~So behave, nigga.

[BCR1@20:BCRASH1]
~z~We want you to do a little favor for us, Carl.

[BCR1@21:BCRASH1]
~z~Yeah, an eye for an eye, and all that.

[BCR1@22:BCRASH1]
~z~I can't believe that nigga Smoke turned on me.

[BCR1@23:BCRASH1]
~z~Smoke? Smoke does exactly what he's told.

[BCR1@24:BCRASH1]
~z~He learned that lesson a long time ago.

[BCR1@25:BCRASH1]
~z~Homies for life? Street loyalty? That's all bullshit, Carl.

[BCR1@26:BCRASH1]
~z~Didn't you learn that when they ran you out of town,

[BCR1@27:BCRASH1]
~z~just cause you'se a buster?

[BCR1@28:BCRASH1]
~z~just 'cause you let Brian die? Huh?

[BCR1@33:BCRASH1]
~z~He's gonna help us with the fight against crime. Right, Carl?

[BCR1@34:BCRASH1]
~z~Yeah. By any means necessary.

[BCR1@35:BCRASH1]
~z~Now you stay the fuck away from Smoke,

[BCR1@36:BCRASH1]
~z~and stay the fuck away from us.

[BCR1@37:BCRASH1]
~z~Otherwise Sweet is going to find himself on a Ballas block

[BCR1@38:BCRASH1]
~z~getting in touch with his feminine side.

[BCR1@39:BCRASH1]
~z~Hey Hernandez, you going to piss all day?

[BCR1@40:BCRASH1]
~z~For some reason, we've got a little problem with a former friend of ours,

[BCR1@41:BCRASH1]
~z~he seems to disagree with some of our methods.

[BCR1@42:BCRASH1]
~z~Yeah, you'll never find anybody as fork-tongued as this snake ass bastard.

[BCR1@43:BCRASH1]
~z~Soon as he gets caught with his hand in the cookie jar,

[BCR1@44:BCRASH1]
~z~he'll whistle any tune Internal Affairs wants him to.

[BCR1@45:BCRASH1]
~z~See, they've got him hiding up Mount Chiliad someplace,

[BCR1@46:BCRASH1]
~z~so they can manipulate his testimony any way they want to.

[BCR1@47:BCRASH1]
~z~I want you to pay him a little visit, Carl. And destroy all his evidence before he testifies.

[BCR1@48:BCRASH1]
~z~Sort this out, Carl, so Officer Tenpenny can sleep easy at night.

[BCR1@49:BCRASH1]
~z~We want evidence he ain't gonna talk.

[BCR1@99:BCRASH1]
~z~Right Ed?

[CAS1A17:CASINO1]
~z~Can't you just give them a little something?

[CAS1A18:CASINO1]
~z~No. In addition to the usual authorities that need bribing,

~z~Insolent bastards!

[CAS3@17:CASINO3]
~z~I'll make sure the cashiers are extra vigilant.

[CAS3@18:CASINO3]
~z~It's obvious where these chips are coming from!

[CAS3@19:CASINO3]
~z~The Sindacco Family owns a plastics factory across town.

[CAS3@20:CASINO3]
~z~I'm gonna blow it to shit!

[CAS3@21:CASINO3]
~z~Man, look, don't trip. I got you on this.

[CAS3_AA:CASINO3]
~z~Hey, who's this character? He looks like a cop to me.

[CAS3_AB:CASINO3]
~z~We better go warn the boss.

[CAS3_AC:CASINO3]
~z~Hey, watch the car, I just got this baby detailed!

[CAS3_AD:CASINO3]
~z~What? He must be a fed! Let's give him a proper Sindacco welcome!

[CAS3_BA:CASINO3]
~z~Hey, what's going on?

[CAS3_BB:CASINO3]
~z~Someone's got a fucking deathwish if they're starting trouble 'round here!

[CAS3_BC:CASINO3]
~z~Get the boys ready! Production line's gotta keep rolling!

[CAS3_BD:CASINO3]
~z~Hey, who's this prick?

[CAS3_BE:CASINO3]
~z~Somebody take care of this joker!

[CAS3_CA:CASINO3]
~z~Hey, Carl, how'd it go?

[CAS4A00:CASINO4]
~z~Hello.

[CAS4A01:CASINO4]
~z~Who am I speaking to?

[CAS4A02:CASINO4]
~z~It's CJ. Hey, Truth, is that you?

[CAS4A03:CASINO4]
~z~Might be.

[CAS4A04:CASINO4]
~z~Might be a government algorithm trying to pick your brains,

[CAS4A05:CASINO4]
~z~so don't admit anything!

[CAS4A06:CASINO4]
~z~Whatever, man. Whassup?

[CAS4A07:CASINO4]
~z~I need a favor, Carl, thought I could cash in some karma chips.

[CAS4A08:CASINO4]
~z~Your credit good.

[CAS4A09:CASINO4]
~z~I took some fellow travelers deep into the desert

[CAS4A10:CASINO4]
~z~on a peyote safari a few nights back.

[CAS4A11:CASINO4]
~z~We faced the inner light and communed with the lizard king.

[CAS4A12:CASINO4]
~z~Sounds fun. How did it go?

[CAS4A13:CASINO4]
~z~That's the problem, I don't know.

[CAS4A14:CASINO4]
~z~I'm in Los Santos.

[CAS4A15:CASINO4]
~z~I woke up in a Japanese bathhouse about an hour ago.

[CAS4A16:CASINO4]
~z~I have no idea how I got here or where the others are.

[CAS4A17:CASINO4]
~z~They're probably fine.

[CAS4A18:CASINO4]
~z~I don't think so.

[CAS4A19:CASINO4]
~z~They were Brits - a band and their managers.

[CAS4A20:CASINO4]
~z~They have no experience about the desert.

[CAS4A21:CASINO4]
~z~OK, where'd you make camp? I can go have a look.

[CAS4A22:CASINO4]
~z~I took 'em up Arco del Oeste - fantastic sunsets.

[CAS4A23:CASINO4]
~z~Best start looking for them up there.

[CAS4B00:CASINO4]
~z~Hello? Hey, anybody out here? Truth sent me!

[CAS4B01:CASINO4]
~z~EH! Over 'ere!

[CAS4B02:CASINO4]
~z~Hey, man, you all right?

~z~'Kin'ell, I'm fucking hanging.

[CAS4B04:CASINO4]
~z~Stone me bloody crows. Where am I?

[CAS4B05:CASINO4]
~z~I dunno, mate. I was having a dream;

[CAS4B06:CASINO4]
~z~I was wanking over some fat bird's tits when this twat turned up.

[CAS4B07:CASINO4]
~z~Oh fuck.

[CAS4B08:CASINO4]
~z~Maccer, you fucking psycho! You did it again, didn't you!

[CAS4B09:CASINO4]
~z~That peyote was shite, you were lucky I brought some tabs along!

[CAS4B10:CASINO4]
~z~I've told you a million times not to put stuff in my fucking drink!

[CAS4B11:CASINO4]
~z~Oh, piss off, kidder!

[CAS4B12:CASINO4]
~z~Who are you again?

[CAS4B13:CASINO4]
~z~Where are we?

[CAS4B14:CASINO4]
~z~Oh, I'm a friend of The Truth's.

[CAS4B15:CASINO4]
~z~He said you guys might need a ride into town or something.

[CAS4B16:CASINO4]
~z~But I'm a fucking raspberry!

[CAS4B17:CASINO4]
~z~You're not a fucking raspberry!

[CAS4B18:CASINO4]
~z~I can't feel me legs, our P.

[CAS4B19:CASINO4]
~z~I've wanked the use out of them!

[CAS4B20:CASINO4]
~z~Just stand up, you soppy cunt.

[CAS4B21:CASINO4]
~z~We go through this every weekend.

[CAS4B22:CASINO4]
~z~Man, what the hell was y'all doing last night?

[CAS4B23:CASINO4]
~z~So, where am I taking y'all?

[CAS4B24:CASINO4]
~z~Anybody got a rag?

[CAS4B25:CASINO4]
~z~I've got a pal, Rosie.

[CAS4B26:CASINO4]
~z~He's got some casino gig going down in Venturas. Sweet.

[CAS4B27:CASINO4]
~z~Fuck off, string.

[CAS4B28:CASINO4]
~z~Oh, charming.

[CAS4B29:CASINO4]
~z~Well it felt like I couldn't feel them, honest!

[CAS4C00:CASINO4]
~z~Kent Paul, here to see Rosie.

[CAS4C01:CASINO4]
~z~Hey boss, there's somebody here to see you.

[CAS4C02:CASINO4]
~z~Oh, go away, I have a migraine.

[CAS4C03:CASINO4]
~z~Oi, Rosie, son, it's me, Paulo!

[CAS4C04:CASINO4]
~z~Oh God.

[CAS4C05:CASINO4]
~z~My despair is complete.

[CAS4C06:CASINO4]
~z~OK, let him in.

[CAS4C07:CASINO4]
~z~Rosiiieee! How are you, me old son?

[CAS4C08:CASINO4]
~z~I pray that one day I can escape my perpetual torment

[CAS4C09:CASINO4]
~z~and retire in peace and comfort a million miles away

[CAS4C10:CASINO4]
~z~from anyone I've ever fucking known and, instead, I get this.

[CAS4C11:CASINO4]
~z~Come on, it's me, Kent Paul!

[CAS4C12:CASINO4]
~z~Well, hello Paul, what a pleasant surprise. Who the hell are these guys?

[CAS4C13:CASINO4]
~z~These are my boys - Maccer and Carl.

[CAS4C14:CASINO4]
~z~Wassup?

[CAS4C15:CASINO4]
~z~You want any Speckled Doves, boss?

[CAS4C16:CASINO4]
~z~I'm peaking on one right now.

[CAS4C17:CASINO4]
~z~Top-of-the-range, man.

[CAS4C18:CASINO4]
~z~Well it's fitting.

[CAS4C19:CASINO4]
~z~As I sit here up to my neck in a river of shit,

[CAS4C20:CASINO4]
~z~with every Mafia gorilla from Liberty City to Los Santos

[CAS4C21:CASINO4]
~z~pissing in my face, that you, Kent Paul, should witness it.

[CAS4C22:CASINO4]
~z~What's the matter, son?

[CAS4C23:CASINO4]
~z~Too numerous, oppressively insurmountable

[CAS4C24:CASINO4]
~z~and depressingly fucking typical even to mention.

[CAS4C25:CASINO4]
~z~It's alright, bruv, Paulo can help.

[CAS4C26:CASINO4]
~z~Give us some space would you, son.

[CAS4C27:CASINO4]
~z~I'll give you a tinkle later.

[CAS4C28:CASINO4]
~z~Alright, for sure.

[CAS4_CL:CASINO4]

[CAS5A00:CASINO5]
~z~Oi, Rosie, liven yourself up, Carl's here.

[CAS5A01:CASINO5]
~z~Hello.

[CAS5A02:CASINO5]
~z~Eh, there's some top fanny down at that pool, Pabsy.

[CAS5A03:CASINO5]
~z~Leave it out, dimlo, what's wrong with you?

[CAS5A04:CASINO5]
~z~Well are you going to tell him, or shall I?

[CAS5A05:CASINO5]
~z~I'm really screwed.

[CAS5A06:CASINO5]
~z~Crack on, Rosie - spit it out.

[CAS5A07:CASINO5]
~z~I threw it all away.

[CAS5A08:CASINO5]
~z~OK, I had the power, the money, the ladies...

[CAS5A09:CASINO5]
~z~But I couldn't lay off the blow, so I went into rehab.

[CAS5A10:CASINO5]
~z~And everything went to shit, but so what?

[CAS5A11:CASINO5]
~z~So when I came out I started representing the Liberty City mob, again

[CAS5A12:CASINO5]
~z~and that's how I ended up here.

[CAS5A13:CASINO5]
~z~But, no one family would trust another family to run the casino,

[CAS5A14:CASINO5]
~z~so I was put forth as a neutral party.

[CAS5A15:CASINO5]
~z~So now I spend my days waiting for one family to cap me

[CAS5A16:CASINO5]
~z~and blame the other one.

[CAS5A17:CASINO5]
~z~My only friend is a bird named Tony.

[CAS5A18:CASINO5]
~z~I never fucked anyone over in my life who didn't have it coming to 'em.

[CAS5A19:CASINO5]
~z~Shit - let me think about this. You're gonna have to break it down for me real quick.

[CAS5A20:CASINO5]
~z~OK, OK - the Sindaccos are on the warpath.

[CAS5A21:CASINO5]
~z~OK? I mean, something terrible has happened to Johnny.

[CAS5A22:CASINO5]
~z~I mean, he's in a shock-induced coma at the hospital across town.

[CAS5A23:CASINO5]
~z~Now the Forellis - they will take this opportunity to rub him out.

[CAS5A24:CASINO5]
~z~Now if any hit between the families succeeds on my turf,

[CAS5A25:CASINO5]
~z~I will get the axe, bullet, machete, whatever...

[CAS5A26:CASINO5]
~z~I'm gonna shoot over to the hospital, and move the body or something.

[CAS5A27:CASINO5]
~z~There you go, my love, things ain't so bad, are they?

[CAS5A28:CASINO5]
~z~Badabing.

[CAS5_AA:CASINO5]
~z~So here I am, about to try and rescue some guy I've scared half to death.

[CAS5_AB:CASINO5]

[CAS5_BA:CASINO5]
~z~Hello, Sir, can I help you?

[CAS5_BB:CASINO5]
~z~Yeah, I'm here to pick up Mr. Sindacco.

[CAS5_BC:CASINO5]
~z~Mr. Sindacco? There must be some mistake.

[CAS5_BD:CASINO5]
~z~An ambulance just picked him up.

[CAS5_BE:CASINO5]
~z~Oh, OK. Thank you for your help.

[CAS5_CA:CASINO5]
~z~Hey mother, mother is that you?

[CAS5_CB:CASINO5]

~z~I need my bag emptied!

[CAS5_DA:CASINO5]
~z~Hey, Johnny, how you feelin'?

[CAS5_DB:CASINO5]
~z~I didn't think he was going to be discharged 'til tomorrow!

[CAS5_EA:CASINO5]
~z~Alright, who's messing with Forelli business?

[CAS5_EB:CASINO5]
~z~Yeah, who's got a death wish?

[CAS5A29:CASINO5]
~z~What's happenin'.

[CAS5A30:CASINO5]
~z~OK, OK, relax.

~z~I dunno, dude. This Rosenberg guy and these two idiots, man.

[CAS7A02:CASINO7]
~z~I kinda feel responsible for them.

[CAS7A03:CASINO7]
~z~Why?

[CAS7A04:CASINO7]
~z~You know me, dude, another mafia leader, a pusher, no problemo.

[CAS7A05:CASINO7]

~z~where did I put it?

[CAS7A15:CASINO7]
~z~Aha! With this!

[CAS7A16:CASINO7]
~z~Yo I'm cool with whacking a Mafia Leader with a nine-iron,

[CAS7A17:CASINO7]
~z~but I'd rather use a weapon of my own choice.

[CAS7A18:CASINO7]
~z~Ah. Well take this anyway.

[CAS7A19:CASINO7]
~z~You never know, it may come in handy...

[CAS7B00:CASINO7]

[CAS9A23:CASINO9]
~z~Their flight gets in soon - traveling as a string quartet.

[CAS9A24:CASINO9]
~z~I was going to send some of the boys over as a little welcoming committee,

[CAS9A25:CASINO9]
~z~but, uh, maybe you can take care of it.

[D10A@01:DSERT10]
~z~Say what?

[D10A@02:DSERT10]
~z~Not all fantastic things are lies, Carl!

[D10A@03:DSERT10]
~z~Today, we'll know EVERYTHING.

[D10A@04:DSERT10]
~z~Oh, I can hardly wait. I hear knowledge is truly sacred in this part of the world.

[D10A@05:DSERT10]
~z~Man, I've tried, but I can't fly for shit.

[D10A@06:DSERT10]
~z~You better do it.

[D10A@07:DSERT10]
~z~Land on the train, kill the guards, get in and steal the stuff.

[D10A@08:DSERT10]
~z~Oh, yeah. What stuff?

[D10A@09:DSERT10]
~z~I don't know yet!

[D10A@10:DSERT10]
~z~I was starting to think you was a lunatic.

[D10A@11:DSERT10]
~z~What do you mean, you don't know yet?

[D10A@12:DSERT10]
~z~You'll be stealing the answer!

[D10A@13:DSERT10]
~z~Look, fly the jet pack. Land on the train.

[D10A@14:DSERT10]
~z~And steal whatever they least want us to get.

[D10A@15:DSERT10]
~z~Shhh. Listen. They're coming.

[D10A@16:DSERT10]
~z~We better go. Peace on earth, dude.

[D10AL00:DSERT10]
~z~Man, why I gotta wait in the middle of the desert for this maniac all the time?

[D10AL01:DSERT10]
~z~Carl, it's The Truth.

[D10AL02:DSERT10]
~z~Hey man, where you at? You sound like you're in a cave, or something.

[D10AL03:DSERT10]
~z~Around. Been eating a lot lately, Carl?

[D10AL04:DSERT10]
~z~Not getting enough exercise?

[D10AL05:DSERT10]
~z~Yeah... I guess.

[D10AL06:DSERT10]
~z~Look, I want you to use that gizmo you acquired,

[D10AL07:DSERT10]
~z~but you gotta lose some of that ballast first, fat ass.

[D10AL08:DSERT10]
~z~Hurry, we've only got a short window for this one.

[D10AL09:DSERT10]
~z~The hell with you!

[D10AL10:DSERT10]
~z~Man, I'm just big boned, that's all...

[D10AL11:DSERT10]
~z~Damn. You'd have thought they'd have a yoga move for this one...

[D10B@00:DSERT10]
~z~You got it, man?

[D10B@01:DSERT10]
~z~I got something.

[D10B@02:DSERT10]
~z~Let me see!

[D10B@03:DSERT10]
~z~Oooh... Everything is different now.

[D10B@04:DSERT10]
~z~What is it?

[D10B@05:DSERT10]
~z~Everything. They will call this 'year zero'.

[D10B@06:DSERT10]
~z~I'll be in touch!

[D10B@07:DSERT10]
~z~Wait! What is... Yeah, see you around.

[D10A@17:DSERT10]
~z~Damn. Where is this fool?

[D10A@18:DSERT10]

[D12@01:DSERT12]
~z~CJ. I've nosed too deep this time!

[D12@02:DSERT12]
~z~I've told you about that stuff, Truthman!

[D12@03:DSERT12]
~z~Lay off the 'caine, dude!

[D12@04:DSERT12]
~z~No. I didn't mean that!

[D12@05:DSERT12]
~z~The grey government want me out of the way!

[D12@06:DSERT12]
~z~Yo, speak up.

[D12@07:DSERT12]
~z~I'm in Bayside,

[D12@08:DSERT12]
~z~Whole town is crawling with dudes in black suits.

[D12@09:DSERT12]
~z~I need your help, CJ!

[D12@10:DSERT12]
~z~I've done some mushrooms, but it hasn't calmed me down at all.

[D12@11:DSERT12]
~z~CJ! They're after me!

[D12@12:DSERT12]
~z~Yo, calm down, I'm on my way.

[D12@13:DSERT12]
~z~Carl.

[D12@14:DSERT12]

~z~Get back in!

{=================================== MISSION TABLE DSERT3 ===================================}

[DES3@00:DSERT3]
~z~Roger that, Big Monkey, I got a 13-6 fat vulture.

[DES3@01:DSERT3]
~z~Need to acquire a drowning baby. Over.

[DES3@02:DSERT3]
~z~In 15 by the fat moon.

[DES3@03:DSERT3]
~z~Break your heart. Over and out.

[DES3@04:DSERT3]
~z~Carl. I need you to do me a favor...

[DES3@05:DSERT3]
~z~Yeah, I'll do you a proper injury, man.

[DES3@06:DSERT3]
~z~What you knowin' about my brother?

[DES3@07:DSERT3]
~z~Relax. He's in prison up state, D Wing. Cell 13.

[DES3@08:DSERT3]
~z~To the left I got a child killer, who wants to rip his throat out.

[DES3@09:DSERT3]
~z~To the right of him I got a white supremacist, who wants to eat his heart, to be precise.

[DES3@10:DSERT3]
~z~Now don't worry. Tenpenny and Pulaski are really relatively benign.

[DES3@11:DSERT3]
~z~Unless of course you're a family member of Officer Pendelbury

[DES3@12:DSERT3]
~z~whom they shot when he threatened to expose them.

[DES3@13:DSERT3]
~z~Damn. Hey, man, how you know all this stuff, man,

[DES3@14:DSERT3]
~z~and why don't you stop it?

[DES3@15:DSERT3]
~z~You just don't understand, do you, kid.

[DES3@16:DSERT3]
~z~Its all white knights and heroes. We have to make decisions, kid.

[DES3@17:DSERT3]
~z~You know, I try to set bad people on other bad people.

[DES3@18:DSERT3]
~z~And sometimes, I let good guys die.

[DES3@19:DSERT3]
~z~He's your brother, but to me, he's just collateral.

[DES3@20:DSERT3]
~z~It's a very delicate decision.

[DES3@21:DSERT3]
~z~Over here, you got all the scumbags inside the country,

[DES3@22:DSERT3]
~z~and over here, you got all the scumbags outside the country.

[DES3@23:DSERT3]
~z~And me and my colleagues. We're the fucking pivot.

[DES3@24:DSERT3]
~z~Keep the government in work. Which reminds me...

[DES3@25:DSERT3]
~z~I need you to head over HERE in the buggy outside.

[DES3@26:DSERT3]
~z~Okay, okay, let off a flare. We got some precious cargo needs collecting.

[DES3@27:DSERT3]
~z~Hey, hold up. What about my brother?

[DES3@28:DSERT3]
~z~and all that shit you was talking about?

[DES3@29:DSERT3]
~z~Don't worry, Sweet's just fine.

[DES3@30:DSERT3]
~z~He gets touched, a prison guard goes home

[DES3@31:DSERT3]
~z~and finds that his wife and kids have been murdered. Everything's under control.

[DES3@32:DSERT3]
~z~We'll talk later. Now, come on, get outta here.

[DES3_AA:DSERT3]
~z~Jesus, what took you?

[DES3_AB:DSERT3]
~z~Toreno! Where you at?!

[DES3_AC:DSERT3]
~z~Miles away. No time for niceties, kid.

[DES3_AD:DSERT3]
~z~Choose a vehicle, grab the equipment I've provided,

[DES3_AE:DSERT3]
~z~get to that drop zone, and wait for that package

[DES3_BA:DSERT3]
~z~That's our cargo arriving now!

[DES3_BB:DSERT3]
~z~Jesus! Will you stop doing that?

[DES3_BC:DSERT3]
~z~Hold up.

[DES3_BD:DSERT3]
~z~Shit, pilot says he's got trouble,

[DES3_BE:DSERT3]
~z~two agency choppers coming in on an intercept.

[DES3_BF:DSERT3]
~z~Can you see them?

[DES3_BG:DSERT3]
~z~Yeah.

[DES3_BH:DSERT3]
~z~Shoot 'em down. Protect the cargo at all costs!

[DES3_CA:DSERT3]
~z~OK, get the package back to Las Brujas.

[DES3_CB:DSERT3]
~z~Where are you?

[DES3_CC:DSERT3]
~z~You givin' me the heebie jeebies, man!

[DES3_CD:DSERT3]
~z~Carl, I will ALWAYS be watching...or listening...or both.

[DES3@33:DSERT3]
~z~But you do know all about that, right?

{=================================== MISSION TABLE DSERT4 ===================================}

[DES4@00:DSERT4]
~z~It's amazing!

[DES4@01:DSERT4]
~z~What's up now, Toreno?

[DES4@02:DSERT4]
~z~This history. It's all lies.

[DES4@03:DSERT4]
~z~It says Hitler killed himself and that we nuked Japan.

[DES4@04:DSERT4]
~z~And people believe this shit. Jesus.

[DES4@05:DSERT4]
~z~Well, if it makes them sleep better at night, I guess.

[DES4@06:DSERT4]
~z~Hey man, what did you want?

[DES4@07:DSERT4]
~z~Is you gonna free my brother?

[DES4@08:DSERT4]
~z~No. Not now.

[DES4@09:DSERT4]
~z~And here's a little newsflash - I said that to get you to do something for me.

[DES4@10:DSERT4]
~z~But the shocker is, we are gonna look after him.

[DES4@11:DSERT4]
~z~Because I need him alive as much as you do.

[DES4@12:DSERT4]
~z~Oh, thanks.

[DES4@13:DSERT4]
~z~You know, after what you've done for me, it's like you're a pro now.

[DES4@14:DSERT4]
~z~I got double agents in Panama who want to put a price on your head.

[DES4@15:DSERT4]
~z~A Russian spy - a little, fat, Boris looking guy - he's asking for clearance to interrogate you,

[DES4@16:DSERT4]
~z~Russian style. Calipers on the genitals. Feels good, you'd like it.

[DES4@17:DSERT4]
~z~That ain't nothing cool, man! Just leave me alone.

[DES4@18:DSERT4]
~z~- You're bad news!~n~- Don't worry about it.

[DES4@19:DSERT4]
~z~Don't worry about it.

[DES4@20:DSERT4]
~z~The Russians got bigger things to worry about than your genitals, believe me.

[DES4@21:DSERT4]
~z~The whole country went to shit.

[DES4@22:DSERT4]
~z~We tried hard to put a lid on it, but that idiot Gorbachev, with the little strawberry on his forehead, he gave away the crown jewels.

[DES4@23:DSERT4]
~z~Still, they got their, you know, their boy in the White House. That was nice...

[DES4@24:DSERT4]
~z~So? What you want me to do?

[DES4@25:DSERT4]
~z~Listen, I need you to buy some property, ok.

[DES4@26:DSERT4]
~z~Shouldn't cost that much. You offer them a dollar.

[DES4@27:DSERT4]
~z~If they give you a hard time, kill them.

[DES4@28:DSERT4]
~z~I'm going to need you to start doing some real wet work here for me soon, OK?

[DES4@29:DSERT4]
~z~Enough of this little girl bullshit. Now get out of here.

[DES4@30:DSERT4]
~z~Man, you real fucked up.

~z~What do you want?

[DES5@03:DSERT5]
~z~Relax. Listen. Can you fly a plane?

[DES5@04:DSERT5]
~z~No. Next question.

[DES5@05:DSERT5]
~z~Will you let me teach you?

[DES5@06:DSERT5]
~z~No. I make it a rule not to defy gravity with compulsive liars.

[DES5@07:DSERT5]
~z~Carl. You scared of flying?

[DES5@08:DSERT5]
~z~No. I'm scared of you. You're a fucking lunatic.

[DES5@09:DSERT5]
~z~Have you heard the bullshit that comes out your mouth?

[DES5@10:DSERT5]
~z~Come on. Be a man, Carl, Your country needs you.

[DES5@11:DSERT5]
~z~Get in the fucking plane.

{=================================== MISSION TABLE DSERT6 ===================================}

[DES6@00:DSERT6]
~z~Got you again, Carl. You're half asleep.

[DES6@01:DSERT6]
~z~I could have killed you in 9 different ways.

[DES6@02:DSERT6]
~z~Wake up and smell the coffee.

[DES6@03:DSERT6]
~z~You need to lay off the coffee.

[DES6@04:DSERT6]
~z~We got a problem.

[DES6@05:DSERT6]
~z~I got some guys out in the field need some equipment.

[DES6@06:DSERT6]
~z~If they don't get it, they'll be dead by nightfall.

[DES6@07:DSERT6]
~z~Then take it to them.

[DES6@08:DSERT6]
~z~Me take it to them?

[DES6@09:DSERT6]
~z~Yeah, why not?

[DES6@10:DSERT6]
~z~I got five guys watching me all the time.

[DES6@11:DSERT6]
~z~Two in that hill. One over there and two by satellite.

[DES6@12:DSERT6]
~z~If I go my guys and I will be dead.

[DES6@13:DSERT6]
~z~I don't have a death wish. I'm a man of peace, son.

[DES6@14:DSERT6]
~z~Yeah, clearly.

[DES6@15:DSERT6]
~z~Take the plane.

[DES6@16:DSERT6]
~z~You're not ready yet so stay low under the radar. Questions?

[DES6@17:DSERT6]
~z~- Yeah, just one thing...~n~- Get to it.

[DES6@18:DSERT6]
~z~Get to it.

[DES6@19:DSERT6]
~z~Wait. Hey. Listen! Listen to me for once.

[DES6@20:DSERT6]
~z~Why won't these guys come after me?

[DES6@21:DSERT6]
~z~Oh, they can't because they're all posted on me.

[DES6@22:DSERT6]
~z~One DEA. One FBI. A Russian, a Cuban double agent and my paymasters.

[DES6@23:DSERT6]
~z~Checks and balances. Nobody is watching anybody watching nobody.

[DES6@24:DSERT6]
~z~You know what I mean? Go.

[DES6_AA:DSERT6]
~z~Hey Carl.

[DES6_AB:DSERT6]
~z~You gotta stay nice and low on your approach or you'll pop up on the radar.

[DES6_AD:DSERT6]
~z~Use the canyon as cover.

[DES6_AE:DSERT6]
~z~You sure this thing's safe, I can see daylight through the floor?

[DES6_AF:DSERT6]
~z~Hey, in that thing you look like an enthusiast.

[DES6_AG:DSERT6]
~z~The US Air Force is less likely to shoot you down.

[DES6_AH:DSERT6]
~z~Cool. What's the problem then?

[DES6_AJ:DSERT6]
~z~I said less likely.

[DES6_AK:DSERT6]
~z~If you did as many amphetamines as these guys do, you'd be lucky not to shoot anything that moves.

[DES6_AM:DSERT6]
~z~Aw, shit.

[DES6_AN:DSERT6]
~z~Hey, just stay low and you'll be fine.

[DES6_BA:DSERT6]
~z~You're flying too high!

[DES6_BB:DSERT6]
~z~Get below the radar!

[DES6_BC:DSERT6]
~z~Stay low, Carl!

[DES6_BD:DSERT6]
~z~Nap of the Earth, Carl, nap of the Earth!

[DES6_CA:DSERT6]
~z~Shit, you've been spotted!

[DES6_CB:DSERT6]
~z~What that mean?

[DES6_CC:DSERT6]
~z~it means they'll send something in the area to go check you out!

[DES6_CD:DSERT6]

~z~Do you have any idea what you're doing for Toreno?

[DES8@10:DSERT8]
~z~No. I seem to be on a need to know basis.

[DES8@11:DSERT8]
~z~Two lies don't cancel each other out.

[DES8@12:DSERT8]
~z~You know that.

[DES8@13:DSERT8]
~z~We pay them to lie to us. Is that what our founding fathers wanted?

[DES8@14:DSERT8]
~z~No more, friend. No more. We're not alone.

[DES8@15:DSERT8]
~z~Get off me, man, what's going on?

[DES8@16:DSERT8]
~z~Everything is going on! Don't you get it?

[DES8@17:DSERT8]
~z~There's a place. Not even on the map.

[DES8@18:DSERT8]

[DES9@01:DSERT9]
~z~Damn!

[DES9@02:DSERT9]
~z~I thought they was your people.

[DES9@03:DSERT9]
~z~Listen, Carl. We've got a problem.

[DES9@04:DSERT9]
~z~Some traitors from another department

[DES9@05:DSERT9]
~z~think they can help the 'overseas situation'

[DES9@06:DSERT9]
~z~by financing militaristic dictators

[DES9@07:DSERT9]
~z~in exchange for arms contracts.

[DES9@08:DSERT9]
~z~Hey, ain't that exactly what you do?

[DES9@09:DSERT9]
~z~Well, kind of, but we get to pick our dictators.

[DES9@10:DSERT9]
~z~Degenerates that we can control.

[DES9@11:DSERT9]
~z~We try to stay the hell away from these guys with principles,

[DES9@12:DSERT9]
~z~Because that just - muddies the waters.

[DES9@13:DSERT9]
~z~Yeah, OK.

[DES9@14:DSERT9]
~z~OK, so, of course these idiots have stolen a consignment of land mines

[DES9@15:DSERT9]
~z~and they plan to offload them in the Middle East, and cause a little ruckus...

[DES9@16:DSERT9]
~z~Carl, do you like maiming people? Just curious...

[DES9@17:DSERT9]
~z~Maiming? Some people, shit...

[DES9@18:DSERT9]
~z~Anyway, the point is - you and me, Carl, we're the same.

[DES9@19:DSERT9]
~z~Now yeah, it's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it.

[DES9@20:DSERT9]
~z~But if you screw this up, it causes a tinder box situation

[DES9@21:DSERT9]
~z~all over Latin America and the Middle East.

[DES9@22:DSERT9]
~z~Now look, I spoke to the big man.

[DES9@23:DSERT9]
~z~You've got clearance to eliminate these fuckers. How's that?

[DES9@24:DSERT9]
~z~Huh, man, kill Government agents?

[DES9@25:DSERT9]
~z~don't look at it that way, will you?

[DES9@26:DSERT9]
~z~Think of it as pest control. It works for me.

[DES9@27:DSERT9]
~z~All right, come on, I can't stay here now. I'm too hip, I gotta go. OK? I'm outta here.

[DES9_AA:DSERT9]

~z~C'mon, man, there's these two guys I know - used to work on marine engines,

[GAR1_AB:GARAGE1]
~z~'til the mob bought their business over in Vice.

[GAR1_AC:GARAGE1]
~z~Now they try and make ends meet by taking any old job.

[GAR1_AD:GARAGE1]
~z~They're a little bit dulled by their habit,

[GAR1_AE:GARAGE1]
~z~but the smoke don't get in the way of their skills with an engine.

[GAR1_AF:GARAGE1]
~z~We'll pick up Jethro first.

[GAR1_BC:GARAGE1]

[GAR1_BD:GARAGE1]
~z~You know how it is, man,

[GAR1_BE:GARAGE1]
~z~a field of tents, crazy-assed music,

[GAR1_BG:GARAGE1]
~z~Polar bears?

[GAR1_BH:GARAGE1]

[GAR1_CA:GARAGE1]
~z~This here's Vietnamese gang territory.

[GAR1_CB:GARAGE1]
~z~Da Nang Boys, Shining Razors, Butterfly Children.

[GAR1_CC:GARAGE1]

~z~Hey there Truth dude!

[GAR1_DC:GARAGE1]
~z~Oh man, do I owe you?

[GAR1_DD:GARAGE1]

[GAR1_FE:GARAGE1]
~z~Do polar bears shit in the woods?

[GAR1_FF:GARAGE1]
~z~No, but they've been known to shit in the liquor tent, if I remember it right.

[GAR1_FG:GARAGE1]
~z~Yeah, that was, like, so far gone, man.

[GAR1_GA:GARAGE1]

[GAR1_HE:GARAGE1]
~z~A what?

[GAR1_HF:GARAGE1]
~z~Exactly.

[GAR1_HG:GARAGE1]
~z~Sometimes it's best to stay in the dark, kid.

[GAR1_JA:GARAGE1]
~z~Dude, Dwaine, man, how's the hot dog business?

[GAR1_JB:GARAGE1]
~z~It's totally shit. Why, what's happenin'?

~z~Like, listen to the man, dude, he's real serious about that shit.

[GAR1_KE:GARAGE1]
~z~Wuh? OK, but you're starting to freak me out with all that space shit, man.

[GAR1_LA:GARAGE1]
~z~OK, you know the drill.

[GAR1_LB:GARAGE1]
~z~Don't look interested in anything.

[GAR1_LC:GARAGE1]
~z~Picture a pink golfball in your mind.

[GAR1_LD:GARAGE1]
~z~OK, we're good to go.

[GAR1_MA:GARAGE1]

[GAR1_MB:GARAGE1]
~z~There's an electronics guy I've had dealings with,

[GAR1_MC:GARAGE1]
~z~goes by the name of ZERO.

[GAR1_MD:GARAGE1]
~z~He could fix a supercomputer with a paperclip.

[GAR1_ME:GARAGE1]
~z~He's got his own shop,

[GAR1_MF:GARAGE1]
~z~but he's always ready to help fellow travelers along the path.

[GAR1_ND:GARAGE1]
~z~Listen to Jethro.

[GAR1_NE:GARAGE1]
~z~Now, what if I told you we never went to the moon,

[GAR1_NF:GARAGE1]

[GAR1_NG:GARAGE1]
~z~and the only reason we've been in a cold war for the last forty-five years,

[GAR1_NH:GARAGE1]
~z~was because snake-headed aliens run the oil business?

[GAR1_NJ:GARAGE1]

[GAR1_NK:GARAGE1]
~z~Good. Keep it that way.

[GAR1_OA:GARAGE1]
~z~Blow the horn.

[GAR1_PF:GARAGE1]
~z~You should drop by the shop sometime, see some of my shit, bro.

[GRO1_CL:GROVE1]
~z~Sweet, man, he did absolutely nothing.

[GRO1_CM:GROVE1]
~z~Next thing I knew B Dup's, he's making money, Grove Street, they set tripping.

[GRO1_CN:GROVE1]
~z~Streets ain't no place to be when every fool is trying to make a move.

[GRO1_CO:GROVE1]

[GR2@22:GROVE2]
~z~Now that ain't fair.

[GR2@23:GROVE2]
~z~Oh - somebody just crossed out all the writing on the wall.

[GR2@24:GROVE2]
~z~Disrespected your hood.

[GR2@25:GROVE2]
~z~And you act like you don't give a fuck.

[GR2@26:GROVE2]

[GRO2_FB:GROVE2]
~z~C'mon, let's go back to Grove Street

[GRO2_GA:GROVE2]
~z~You helped Grove Street Families hammer those Ballas.

[GRO2_GB:GROVE2]
~z~Johnson boys rolled right over them!

[GRO2_GC:GROVE2]
~z~OK, dog, I'm going to get some sleep, I'm beat.

[GRO2_GD:GROVE2]

[HST1A03:HEIST1]
~z~Oh, I thought I had. This window here must let some light in.

~z~Well, we don't want to be party to preparation of a daring raid on the count room!

[SHEX2B:HEIST1]
~z~Does sir understand?

[SHEX2Y:HEIST1]
~z~Oh, of course, the owners wouldn't want to take a gamble on that happening!

{=================================== MISSION TABLE HEIST2 ===================================}

[HST4A00:HEIST2]
~z~It seems impossible to keep a secret around here!

[HST4A01:HEIST2]
~z~I would have thought the size of the room would keep the numbers down.

[HST4A02:HEIST2]
~z~the size of this room might have limited

[HST4A03:HEIST2]
~z~the number of people that were in on this job.

[HST4A04:HEIST2]
~z~Hey, speak up, we can't hear you back here!

[HST4A05:HEIST2]
~z~I appreciate your input,

[HST4A06:HEIST2]
~z~but please, fuck off.

[HST4A07:HEIST2]
~z~What did he say?

[HST4A12:HEIST2]
~z~Great.

[HST4A13:HEIST2]
~z~Hey, where's the coffee and donuts?

[HST4A14:HEIST2]
~z~OK, look, I'm going to go shut off the city's power source.

[HST4A15:HEIST2]
~z~Woozie, look after these fools for me.

[HST4A16:HEIST2]
~z~OK, now, the important thing to remember with a plan like this,

[HST4A17:HEIST2]
~z~is that... nothing can go wrong.

[HE2_AA:HEIST2]
~z~Hey, I found him, he's over here!

[HE2_AB:HEIST2]
~z~He's in there somewhere, start looking!

[HE2_AC:HEIST2]
~z~The cops are on the way, this thrill seeker ain't gonna escape!

[HE2_AD:HEIST2]
~z~We got a light saying there's been a break in!

~z~That's the guy, arrest him!

~z~Stop him, for chrisakes!

[HE2_AH:HEIST2]
~z~Always get the nut jobs on my shift!

[HE2_AJ:HEIST2]
~z~Must be seeing things. I thought that coffee tasted a bit odd!

[HE2_AK:HEIST2]
~z~Finally, some action around here!

[HE2_AL:HEIST2]
~z~Where the hell did he go?

[HE2_BA:HEIST2]
~z~Any sign of him yet?

[HE2_BB:HEIST2]
~z~Not yet, but we've locked the quay entrance and the cops are on the way.

[HE2_CA:HEIST2]

[HST2A00:HEIST3]
~z~Very clever. So what's the prognosis?

[HST2A01:HEIST3]
~z~Is this just going to be extremely difficult, or next-to-impossible?

[HST2A02:HEIST3]
~z~Hear me out on this, homie.

[HST2A03:HEIST3]
~z~Alright, the cash room is on the bottom level.

[HST2A04:HEIST3]
~z~There's a bunch of rooms and a tunnel under the whole building

[HST2A05:HEIST3]
~z~with access to the casino floors at either end of the complex. Alright?

[HST2A06:HEIST3]
~z~Now, security consists of CCTV, a keycode access and, in places, a swipe card.

~z~Hey, are you pointing again?

[HST2A08:HEIST3]
~z~Oh, my bad - habit.

[HST2A09:HEIST3]
~z~Ah, don't worry; it's good practice for when we

[HST2A10:HEIST3]
~z~finally get a crew in on this.

[HST2A11:HEIST3]
~z~Yeah, I know.

[HST2A12:HEIST3]

~z~Well, then we've got our first recruit.

[HST2A15:HEIST3]
~z~Come on in and shut the door.

[HST2A16:HEIST3]
~z~Alright, cool. This is a security card reader that Zero's sent over.

[HST2A17:HEIST3]
~z~Now all we need to do is get one of those cards...

[HE3_AA:HEIST3]
~z~Luckily, there's always one guaranteed weak link in any security set up.

[HE3_AB:HEIST3]
~z~The human heart.

[HE3_BA:HEIST3]
~z~Another shift over! See you tomorrow!

[HE3_BB:HEIST3]

[HE3_DF:HEIST3]

[HE3_EA:HEIST3]
~z~Where's the keycard?

[HE3_EB:HEIST3]
~z~Confess!

[HE3_EC:HEIST3]
~z~You'll never break me!

[HE3_FA:HEIST3]
~z~Enough, master!

~z~Now I know you're blind, man - but you gotta see this.

{=================================== MISSION TABLE HEIST4 ===================================}

[HST5A00:HEIST4]
~z~Alright, here's the plan. It's all about the art of deception.

[HST5A01:HEIST4]
~z~While I get as much heat on me as possible,

[HST5A02:HEIST4]
~z~Y'all get away with the green.

[HST5A03:HEIST4]
~z~Question: how does the Mafia normally move cash out of Caligula's?

[HST5A04:HEIST4]
~z~Bingo! Stripes for Mr. Zero here.

[HST5A05:HEIST4]
~z~Ha hey! Good job, you little ass kisser!

[HST5A06:HEIST4]
~z~So, we're going to steal ourselves an armored car

[HST5A07:HEIST4]
~z~and re-spray it so it looks like one of their regular trucks.

[HST5A08:HEIST4]
~z~What about the police escorts?

[HST5A09:HEIST4]
~z~Whenever they move cash around they use police motorcycles as outriders.

[HST5A10:HEIST4]
~z~Exactly what I was thinking.

[HST5A11:HEIST4]
~z~C'mon, come with me, and we're gonna go get some cop wheels...

[HE4_AA:HEIST4]
~z~Okay, that should do us.

[HE4_AB:HEIST4]
~z~Take care of those bikes.

[HE4_AC:HEIST4]
~z~Now get out of here!

[HE4_BA:HEIST4]
~z~Come in control; I was doing a walk-the-line on some drunk at the pizza place

[HE4_BB:HEIST4]
~z~and my bike's been stolen!

[HE4_BC:HEIST4]
~z~Larry, some prick's trying your bike for size!

[HE4_BD:HEIST4]
~z~Get him!

[HE4_BF:HEIST4]
~z~I'm at the hospital and, well, some joker's stolen my bike!

[HE4_BG:HEIST4]
~z~All units, this is an APB for a serial patrol bike thief.

[HE4_BJ:HEIST4]
~z~Suspect is black male, about six feet tall, and light build,

[HE4_BK:HEIST4]
~z~Suspect is black male, about six feet tall, and medium build,

[HE4_BL:HEIST4]
~z~Suspect is black male, about six feet tall, and heavy build,

[HE4_BM:HEIST4]
~z~Oh, and a stupid haircut!

[HE4_CA:HEIST4]
~z~You get the Packer, hit the Julius Thruway and keep moving.

[HE4_CB:HEIST4]
~z~I'll steal the bikes and get them to you.

[HST5A12:HEIST4]
~z~Ha ha, tha... Ow... Ow?

{=================================== MISSION TABLE HEIST5 ===================================}

[HST6A00:HEIST5]
~z~OK, we got the bikes. And Woozie's taken care of the uniforms.

[HST6A01:HEIST5]
~z~Now, we just gotta get an armored van

[HST6A02:HEIST5]
~z~and re-spray it with the Caligula's Casino logo.

[HST6A03:HEIST5]
~z~Why don't we steal one while it's on its rounds?

[HST6A04:HEIST5]
~z~That way we can make some money too.

[HST6A05:HEIST5]
~z~No, I don't want to get the crew caught up in some street level jacking - it could get ugly.

[HST6A06:HEIST5]
~z~I... I have an idea? Um...

[HST6A07:HEIST5]
~z~Have you ever seen those helicopters they use to lift heavy loads?

[HST6A08:HEIST5]
~z~they use to airlift heavy loads?

[HST6A09:HEIST5]
~z~Yeah, they call 'em 'sky cranes'.

[HST6A10:HEIST5]
~z~We could lift the whole truck and take them to someplace safe.

[HST6A11:HEIST5]
~z~Then we need to steal a sky crane.

[HST6A12:HEIST5]
~z~Unfortunately I'm not a pilot.

[HST6A13:HEIST5]
~z~No, me neither.

[HST6A14:HEIST5]
~z~Hey, don't look at me.

[HST6A15:HEIST5]
~z~Or me.

[HST6A16:HEIST5]

~z~You got him?

[HE8_PC:HEIST9]
~z~Carl, this is a battle between two coding behemoths.

[HE8_PD:HEIST9]
~z~Like two giant nuclear monsters trampling a city underfoot,

[HE8_PE:HEIST9]
~z~we struggle for dominion over the tiny, puny earth.

[HE8_PF:HEIST9]

~z~Hey, be quiet, be quiet.

[ROT1@01:RIOT1]
~z~C'mon you bunch of wankers, this is unbearable!

[ROT1@02:RIOT1]
~z~SHUT UP!

[ROT1@03:RIOT1]
~z~Officers Eddie Pulaski and Frank Tenpenny,

[ROT1@04:RIOT1]
~z~both hard working members of a community policing unit,

[ROT1@05:RIOT1]
~z~have been charged with racketeering,

[ROT1@06:RIOT1]
~z~corruption, narcotics and sexual assault.

[ROT1@07:RIOT1]
~z~They brought it on themselves.

[ROT1@08:RIOT1]
~z~That bastard cost me my farm. And he hogged the bong.

[ROT1@09:RIOT1]
~z~But these charges pale in comparison to the core allegation;

[ROT1@10:RIOT1]
~z~... conspired to kill fellow officer Ralph Pendelbury

[ROT1@11:RIOT1]
~z~who had threatened to turn state's evidence

[ROT1@12:RIOT1]
~z~and who was then found shot dead

[ROT1@13:RIOT1]
~z~in a supposedly unrelated gang incident...

[ROT1@14:RIOT1]
~z~I'd say 20 years.

[ROT1@15:RIOT1]
~z~- Try 5 years. Cops always get off easy.~n~- Yeah, I heard that.

[ROT1@16:RIOT1]
~z~...to deal with lost evidence,

[ROT1@17:RIOT1]
~z~...retracted witness statements

[ROT1@18:RIOT1]
~z~and now the disappearance of fellow officer Jimmy Hernandez,

[ROT1@19:RIOT1]
~z~including fellow officer Jimmy Hernandez,

[ROT1@20:RIOT1]
~z~and Officer Pulaski himself, believed to be on the run.

[ROT1@21:RIOT1]
~z~Oh, wait, they're exiting the courtroom now!

[ROT1@22:RIOT1]
~z~That bastard Pulaski will probably turn up dead, just like the rest of them.

[ROT1@23:RIOT1]
~z~...of the lack of evidence against my client,

[ROT1@24:RIOT1]
~z~the district attorney's office has seen fit

[ROT1@25:RIOT1]
~z~to drop all charges...

[ROT1@26:RIOT1]
~z~What?!

[ROT1@27:RIOT1]
~z~I hope we can draw a line under this whole sorry affair

[ROT1@28:RIOT1]
~z~and leave officer Tenpenny to do what he does best;

[ROT1@29:RIOT1]
~z~Protect and serve!

[ROT1@30:RIOT1]
~z~Thank you.

[ROT1@31:RIOT1]
~z~You see? You can't trust the system, man.

[ROT1@32:RIOT1]
~z~If the reaction of the crowd behind me is anything to judge by,

[ROT1@33:RIOT1]
~z~...Los Santos will burn tonight!

[ROT1@34:RIOT1]
~z~You see? You can't trust the system, man!

[ROT1@35:RIOT1]
~z~Oh man, there just ain't no JUSTICE!

[ROT1@36:RIOT1]
~z~I know, I've been arrested numerous times

[ROT1@37:RIOT1]
~z~for totally natural behavior!

[ROT1@38:RIOT1]
~z~Ain't nobody gonna be rioting in my hood!

[ROT1_BE:RIOT1]
~z~And we will Sweet.

[ROT1_DA:RIOT1]
~z~Shit, look at this place, even old ladies robbing shit!

[ROT1_DB:RIOT1]
~z~I guess it's better than staying home and watching the shopping channel.

[ROT1_DC:RIOT1]
~z~Yeah, go out there and get yourself a bargain!

[ROT1_EA:RIOT1]
~z~So who's the weird Brit?

[ROT1_EB:RIOT1]

~z~I like this place, you know.

[STL2_BB:STEAL2]

[STL2_BC:STEAL2]
~z~San Fierro, man.

[STL2_BD:STEAL2]
~z~My home will always be the Varrios and El Corona,

[STL2_BE:STEAL2]
~z~but this city, it has something gentle about it.

[STL2_BF:STEAL2]
~z~Yeah, I know what you mean.

[STL2_BG:STEAL2]
~z~Kendl seems to like it too, you know?

[STL2_BH:STEAL2]
~z~Oh yeah, she's really getting her head into this business thing.

[STL2_BJ:STEAL2]
~z~That's good, she's always been the brains in the family.

[STL2_BK:STEAL2]
~z~She should get out the ghetto and make something of herself.

[STL2_BL:STEAL2]
~z~I think she's aiming to make something out of ALL of us, eh!

[STL2_BM:STEAL2]
~z~Yeah, she's the moms of the family now...

[STL2_CA:STEAL2]
~z~Hey, who's this 'Truth' guy, holmes? I don't think he's wrapped too tight!

[STL2_CB:STEAL2]
~z~He just sees everything from a different perspective, that's all.

[STL2_CC:STEAL2]
~z~At first I thought he was just another acid casualty fruit cake.

[STL2_CD:STEAL2]
~z~But some of the things he say...

[STL2_CE:STEAL2]
~z~I don't know, man, it ain't all bullshit....

[STL2_CF:STEAL2]
~z~Hey, you gonna become an alien hunter, holmes?

[STL2_CG:STEAL2]
~z~I'll take a rain check on that one.

[STL2_DA:STEAL2]

[STL2_DJ:STEAL2]
~z~Second floor? Shit!

[STL2_DK:STEAL2]
~z~Aw great! Why is nothing ever easy?

[STL2_EA:STEAL2]
~z~Can I help you two, eerr, gentlemen?

[STL2_EB:STEAL2]
~z~Yeah, you can help us by going to help some other motherfucker.

[STL2_EC:STEAL2]

[STL2_ED:STEAL2]
~z~Alright, CJ, it's time to roll!

[STL2_EE:STEAL2]

[STL2_FD:STEAL2]
~z~Beat the tram up the hill!

[STL2_FE:STEAL2]
~z~Piece of chocolate cake!

[STL2_FF:STEAL2]
~z~This tram driver must be shitting himself, holmes!

[STL2_FG:STEAL2]

[STL2_FL:STEAL2]
~z~OK, Cesar, that's enough fun.

[STL2_FM:STEAL2]
~z~Let's get these cars back to the garage!

[STL2_FN:STEAL2]
~z~OK, CJ, hey, I know a quick route!

[STL2_FO:STEAL2]
~z~Hello. Cops, back again you idiotas?

[STL2_FP:STEAL2]
~z~Get out of the fucking road!

[STL2_FQ:STEAL2]
~z~Holy SHIIIIIIIT!

[STL2_FR:STEAL2]
~z~Fuck, holmes, did you see that?

[STL2_GA:STEAL2]
~z~Can we think about getting back

[STL2_GB:STEAL2]
~z~before I end up in a carwreck barbeque?

[STL2_HA:STEAL2]
~z~Sure thing, holmes.

[STL2_HB:STEAL2]
~z~I think we lost 'em.

[STL2_HC:STEAL2]
~z~There's a shortcut this way!

[STL2_HD:STEAL2]
~z~Uh-oh, more cops!

[STL2_HE:STEAL2]
~z~BACK UP, HOLMES, BACK UP! BACK UP!

[STL2_HF:STEAL2]
~z~OK, we're good.

[STL4@01:STEAL4]
~z~Shit, I just changed that seal!

[STL4@02:STEAL4]
~z~Must have got a crimp in it, damn!

[STL4@03:STEAL4]
~z~Hey Ces, your boy is here.

[STL4@04:STEAL4]
~z~He ain't my boy.

[STL4@05:STEAL4]
~z~Hey, we're almost living a normal life, huh. This is far from Grove Street, right?

[STL4@06:STEAL4]
~z~Yeah, I know, but I just can't get it out of the back of my mind.

[STL4@07:STEAL4]
~z~Moms, Sweet, Smoke - I just can't let that go.

[STL4@08:STEAL4]
~z~I know. So what we going to do about Sweet?

[STL4@09:STEAL4]
~z~It's a shitty situation but I've got to let it play out a little longer, OK?

[STL4@10:STEAL4]
~z~OK, but be careful. We ain't trying to lose you again.

[STL4@11:STEAL4]
~z~I know a guy who knows a guy

[STL4@12:STEAL4]
~z~who handles freight containers down on the docks.

[STL4@13:STEAL4]
~z~He saw one of the containers was loading up cars

[STL4@14:STEAL4]
~z~and one was a match for a car on a customer's wish list.

[STL4@15:STEAL4]
~z~So, he marked the container with a spray can,

[STL4@16:STEAL4]
~z~but it might be too late,

[STL4@17:STEAL4]
~z~the ship's loading and it moves out tomorrow.

[STL4@18:STEAL4]
~z~OK, let's go peep it out - see what we can see.

[STL4_AA:STEAL4]
~z~C'mon, ese, you can drive!

[STL4_AB:STEAL4]
~z~Don't I always!

[STL4_BA:STEAL4]
~z~How we going to steal a car off a container ship, holmes?

[STL4_BB:STEAL4]
~z~You know, the same way they got on - use a dockside crane!

[STL4_BC:STEAL4]
~z~Man, those things are real high up - I ain't too good with ladders and I'm afraid of heights!

[STL4_BD:STEAL4]
~z~OK, I'll use the crane, you better be ready to crack the container.

[STL4_CA:STEAL4]
~z~That's the ship, CJ!

[STL4_CB:STEAL4]
~z~OK, I'll go sort out the crane. Gimme a second.

[STL4_CC:STEAL4]

[STL4_DA:STEAL4]

[STL4_DB:STEAL4]
~z~We'll just have to try one at a time, eh!

[STL4_DC:STEAL4]

[STL4_EA:STEAL4]
~z~OK, CJ, this is the one, good work, holmes!

[STL4_FA:STEAL4]
~z~Not this one, CJ!

[STL4_FB:STEAL4]
~z~No luck, CJ, try another!

[STL4_FC:STEAL4]
~z~Not this one either, it must be the last one!

[STL4_GA:STEAL4]
~z~Hey! What the fuck do you think you're doing?

[STL4_GB:STEAL4]
~z~Hey, hold it right there!

[STL4_GC:STEAL4]

~z~CJ, The car's on the tracks!

[STL4_LA:STEAL4]
~z~There gotta be an easier way of earning a living then this.

[STL4_LB:STEAL4]
~z~Sure, holmes, I guess.

[STL4_LC:STEAL4]
~z~but what else are you qualified for?

[STL4_LD:STEAL4]
~z~Yeah, I feel you.

[STL4_LE:STEAL4]
~z~Man let's give these cops a run for there money.

[STL4_MA:STEAL4]
~z~Hey, CJ!

[STL4_MB:STEAL4]
~z~We get paid on the condition of the car, holmes!

[STL4_MC:STEAL4]
~z~Be more careful!

[STL4_MD:STEAL4]
~z~Who's driving? Me or you?

[STL4_NA:STEAL4]
~z~That was like a piece of tortilla!

[STL4_NB:STEAL4]
~z~Hey, holmes, that was fun, we should do that again!

[STL4@19:STEAL4]
~z~That's right, sis - good looking out.

[STL4@20:STEAL4]

{=================================== MISSION TABLE STEAL5 ===================================}

~z~Hey man, where you been?

[STL5@01:STEAL5]
~z~I tracked one of the cars on our shopping list,

[STL5@02:STEAL5]
~z~but the crazy bitch, she drives like the devil!

[STL5@03:STEAL5]
~z~I've been following her for hours, but she stops for nothing!

[STL5@04:STEAL5]
~z~You'd have to ram her off the road in order to get a chance

[STL5@05:STEAL5]
~z~to get her car and you know a wrecked car is no good to us!

[STL5@06:STEAL5]
~z~I swear she is playing with me!

[STL5@07:STEAL5]
~z~Dude, calm down!

[STL5@08:STEAL5]
~z~If she's playing with you,

[STL5@09:STEAL5]
~z~then she probably won't get one-time involved until it turns ugly.

[STL5@10:STEAL5]
~z~We gotta find a way to stop her, or slow her down.

[STL5@11:STEAL5]
~z~Too bad we can't involve the police,

[STL5@12:STEAL5]
~z~'cuz then they could pop her crazy bitch tires

[STL5@13:STEAL5]
~z~and bang her crazy bitch ass in jail

[STL5@14:STEAL5]
~z~for being a danger to my sanity!

[STL5@15:STEAL5]
~z~Dude, relax!

[STL5@16:STEAL5]

~z~YOU SNITCH PIECE OF SHIT!

[CRV2@08:VCR2]
~z~YOU VATO ASSHOLE!

[CRV2@09:VCR2]
~z~YOU SOLD US OUT!

[CRV2@10:VCR2]
~z~Time to dig, Carl.

[CRV2@11:VCR2]
~z~You take care of things.

[CRV2@12:VCR2]
~z~Whuh - where you going?

[CRV2@13:VCR2]
~z~To get drunk and get laid - you got a problem with that?

[CRV2@14:VCR2]
~z~No, Frank, relax.

[CRV2@15:VCR2]
~z~Good. I'll see you back at the precinct.

[CRV2@16:VCR2]
~z~And I'll see YOU in the next life, Carl.

[CRV2@17:VCR2]
~z~Awright, that's good - that's deep enough for two.

[CRV2@18:VCR2]
~z~Eddie, Tenpenny's just using you, he's using all of us.

[CRV2@19:VCR2]
~z~You're the next one he's gonna silence, man.

[CRV2@20:VCR2]
~z~Shut the fuck up, scum! And it's Officer Pulaski to you!

[CRV2@21:VCR2]
~z~Fucking die!!

[VCR2_AA:VCR2]
~z~Hey Eddie! You know Tenpenny gonna rub you out too!

[VCR2_AB:VCR2]
~z~Carl, you got it all wrong, pal!

[VCR2_AC:VCR2]
~z~Tenpenny was the one saving your ass!

[VCR2_AD:VCR2]
~z~Every time I wanted to get rid of you he'd find some excuse to keep you alive!

[VCR2_AE:VCR2]
~z~Well, now it's up to me, and I ain't such a fucking soft touch!

[VCR2_BA:VCR2]
~z~So how's your sister?

[VCR2_BB:VCR2]
~z~I always had a thing for her.

[VCR2_BC:VCR2]
~z~Tenpenny and I got some great shots of her and her varrio boyfriend going at it like a couple of horny Chihuahuas.

[VCR2_BD:VCR2]
~z~going at it like two horny Chihuahuas.

[VCR2_BE:VCR2]
~z~Man, does she put out like a pro!

[VCR2_BF:VCR2]
~z~Screw you Pulaski!

[VCR2_BG:VCR2]
~z~I know what you're trying to do, and you ain't gonna crawl inside my head.

[VCR2_BH:VCR2]
~z~I ain't kidding!

[VCR2_BJ:VCR2]
~z~It's the best stake-out I ever done!

[VCR2_CA:VCR2]
~z~Carl, you should have seen your moms before she was buried.

[VCR2_CB:VCR2]
~z~She was a real mess - most her face was hanging off!

[VCR2_CC:VCR2]
~z~Don't fucking talk about my Moms!

[VCR2_CD:VCR2]
~z~The boys, you know, they fooled around with her at the scene, you know...

[VCR2_CE:VCR2]
~z~... touching her, joking around and shit.

[VCR2_CF:VCR2]
~z~Fuck you, Pulaski, FUCK YOU!

[VCR2_CG:VCR2]
~z~Heh heh heh!

[VCR2_DA:VCR2]
~z~Not feeling so fucking full of yourself now, huh?

[VCR2_DB:VCR2]
~z~Yeah, well them's the breaks... fuck...

[VCR2_DC:VCR2]
~z~Any last requests?

[VCR2_DD:VCR2]
~z~Yeah... can I fuck your sister?

[VCR2_DE:VCR2]
~z~You a asshole to the end. Punk motherfucker!

{=================================== MISSION TABLE WUZI1 ===================================}

[WOO1@00:WUZI1]
~z~We're closed! Pokgai!

[WOO1@01:WUZI1]
~z~Easy, man, I'm here to see Woozie.

[WOO1@02:WUZI1]
~z~Oh. Upstairs.

[WOO1@03:WUZI1]
~z~I'm Johnson. I'm here to see Woozie, I work with him.

[WOO1@04:WUZI1]
~z~You know of the boss's curse?

[WOO1@05:WUZI1]
~z~Curse? Nah.

[WOO1@06:WUZI1]
~z~He's blind.

[WOO1@07:WUZI1]
~z~Blind? But we was just racing cars last week!

[WOO1@08:WUZI1]
~z~Yes, I know. He is blessed with unbelievable good fortune.

[WOO1@09:WUZI1]
~z~And the Triad that would do anything for him.

[WOO1@10:WUZI1]
~z~We call him our Lucky Mole.

[WOO1@11:WUZI1]
~z~A'ight. I'll keep that in mind.

[WOO1@12:WUZI1]
~z~Good.

[WOO1@13:WUZI1]
~z~Woozie!

[WOO1@14:WUZI1]
~z~Hello, Carl.

[WOO1@15:WUZI1]
~z~Hey, what's happening Woozie - y'know, how you doin'?

[WOO1@16:WUZI1]
~z~Straight to the facts;

[WOO1@17:WUZI1]
~z~I can't use your help unless I'm open with you

[WOO1@18:WUZI1]
~z~about who I am and what I do.

[WOO1@19:WUZI1]
~z~Let me re-introduce myself...

[WOO1@20:WUZI1]
~z~I am the boss of the Mountain Cloud Boys.

[WOO1@21:WUZI1]
~z~Nice to meet you.

[WOO1@22:WUZI1]
~z~Likewise. Why don't you sit down.

[WOO1@23:WUZI1]
~z~As Dai Dai Lo of the Triad, it is my responsibility to see

[WOO1@24:WUZI1]
~z~that disputes are settled without...damaging important business.

[WOO1@25:WUZI1]
~z~Where I come in at?

[WOO1@26:WUZI1]
~z~We shall see.

[WOO1@27:WUZI1]
~z~I'm about to drop in on a local Triad

[WOO1@28:WUZI1]
~z~that failed to show face at the last Tong meeting.

[WOO1@29:WUZI1]
~z~Come with me, and you'll see how we Triads settle things

[WOO1@30:WUZI1]
~z~without recourse to...unnecessary violence.

[WOO1@31:WUZI1]
~z~A'ight, I'll ride with you.

[WUZ1_AA:WUZI1]
~z~We'll need a ride, mine's getting some bodywork done to it.

[WUZ1_AB:WUZI1]
~z~Alright, don't trip.

[WUZ1_BA:WUZI1]
~z~Hurry up, Woozie. What's the problem?

[WUZ1_BB:WUZI1]
~z~Yeah, err, I'm just checking my bearings.

[WUZ1_CA:WUZI1]
~z~The Blood Feather Triad have a storehouse around the block.

[WUZ1_CB:WUZI1]
~z~We shall see what excuses they have to offer.

[WUZ1_CC:WUZI1]
~z~OK. So what's all this talk of business?

[WUZ1_CD:WUZI1]
~z~Some small time Vietnamese gangs have been making trouble lately.

[WUZ1_CE:WUZI1]
~z~We're not sure why they're gaining any courage now, but I'm nervous about the situation.

[WUZ1_CG:WUZI1]
~z~How do I fit in all of this?

[WUZ1_CH:WUZI1]
~z~You're an outsider.

[WUZ1_DA:WUZI1]
~z~This is the place!

[WUZ1_DB:WUZI1]
~z~What's that smell?

[WUZ1_DC:WUZI1]
~z~Laundry.

[WUZ1_DD:WUZI1]
~z~Come on, it's this way.

[WUZ1_EA:WUZI1]
~z~Hey, what's with all these people?

[WUZ1_EB:WUZI1]
~z~Where they going?

[WUZ1_EC:WUZI1]
~z~Something isn't right here. We should be careful...

[WUZ1_EE:WUZI1]
~z~Follow me.

[WUZ1_FA:WUZI1]
~z~Something's not right.

[WUZ1_FB:WUZI1]
~z~No shit, where everybody at?

[WUZ1_FC:WUZI1]
~z~Hiding, scared. I can smell them.

[WUZ1_FD:WUZI1]
~z~We should proceed with caution.

[WUZ1_FE:WUZI1]
~z~This way, I think.

[WUZ1_GA:WUZI1]
~z~Hold on, just getting my bearings.

[WUZ1_GB:WUZI1]
~z~This is very interesting...

[WUZ1_GC:WUZI1]
~z~Hmmm, yes, intriguing...

[WUZ1_GD:WUZI1]
~z~With the wind on my right, sooo...

[WUZ1_GE:WUZI1]
~z~Was it fifteen paces, or fifteen feet?

[WUZ1_GF:WUZI1]
~z~Ah, no, now I've got it...

[WUZ1_GG:WUZI1]
~z~Two stalls then turn left, no, no, right...

[WUZ1_GH:WUZI1]
~z~That's the smell I was after.

[WUZ1_GJ:WUZI1]
~z~Now... where's that loose cobble?

[WUZ1_GK:WUZI1]
~z~Should be a sewer right about here...

[WUZ1_GL:WUZI1]
~z~Ah, the unmistakable skitter of tiny rat feet!

[WUZ1_GM:WUZI1]
~z~18, 19, twenty. Now was it right or left?

[WUZ1_HA:WUZI1]
~z~Do you hear something?

[WUZ1_HB:WUZI1]
~z~Yeah, traffic and other shit.

[WUZ1_HC:WUZI1]
~z~Exactly! Trust me, I know what I'm doing. Follow me!

[WUZ1_JA:WUZI1]
~z~Hey, what the hell you doin'?

[WUZ1_JB:WUZI1]
~z~Just, eerr, checking the, um, y'know. Shut up, Carl.... THIS WAY!

[WUZ1_KA:WUZI1]
~z~What's wrong? You lost? Need a hand?

[WUZ1_KB:WUZI1]
~z~NO!

[WUZ1_KC:WUZI1]
~z~No, I was just, you know, getting the feel of the place.

[WUZ1_KD:WUZI1]
~z~Stick Close!

[WUZ1_LA:WUZI1]
~z~Ah, we're here! This way!

[WUZ1_LB:WUZI1]
~z~Here, this is the place.

[WUZ1_LC:WUZI1]
~z~Strange, this gate is usually locked.

[WUZ1_LD:WUZI1]
~z~Odd, this gate should be locked...

[WUZ1_MA:WUZI1]
~z~Oh man, Woozie...

[WUZ1_MB:WUZI1]
~z~What's got spooked?

[WUZ1_MC:WUZI1]
~z~Oh, oh sorry, didn't see you lying down there.

[WUZ1_MD:WUZI1]
~z~He's dead. They all are.

[WUZ1_ME:WUZI1]
~z~The Blood Feathers, wiped out?

[WUZ1_MF:WUZI1]
~z~Dai Dai Lo! Forgive me, I was too scared to fight, so I hid.

[WUZ1_MG:WUZI1]
~z~Enough! What happened here?

[WUZ1_MH:WUZI1]
~z~Vietnamese surprised us, cut us all down.

[WUZ1_MJ:WUZI1]
~z~Shit, here they come again!

[WUZ1_NA:WUZI1]
~z~The Triads must have vengeance!

[WUZ1_NB:WUZI1]
~z~CJ, follow me and stick close!

[WUZ1_NC:WUZI1]
~z~Ready?

[WUZ1_ND:WUZI1]
~z~DIE YOU MOTHERFUCKING SONS OF WHORES!

[WUZ1_NE:WUZI1]
~z~Looks clear to me, go! Go!

[WUZ1_NF:WUZI1]
~z~I think I got them all!

[WUZ1_NG:WUZI1]
~z~Hell's sewers, that was a sniper bullet!

[WUZ1_NH:WUZI1]
~z~Damn, I err, got something in my eyes, is it safe to move?

[WUZ1_NJ:WUZI1]
~z~YOUR MOTHERS WERE DEMON SLUTS!

[WUZ1_NK:WUZI1]
~z~YOUR BLOOD WILL RUN LIKE WINE!

[WUZ1_NL:WUZI1]
~z~EAT THIS HOT LEADEN SHIT!

[WUZ1_NM:WUZI1]
~z~YOU WILL WANDER AS GHOSTS!

[WUZ1_NN:WUZI1]
~z~CURSED ASSHOLES!

[WUZ1_NO:WUZI1]
~z~CJ, take out that sniper!

[WUZ1_NP:WUZI1]
~z~Cover me, CJ, I'm moving up!

[WUZ1_NQ:WUZI1]
~z~I'm breaking cover, CJ, spray 'em!

[WUZ1_OA:WUZI1]
~z~Oh fuck, man, more up ahead!

[WUZ1_OB:WUZI1]
~z~Shit, man, they really want you dead!

[WUZ1_OC:WUZI1]
~z~I see him. He on the roof!

[WUZ1_OD:WUZI1]
~z~OK, clear, Woozie, GO!

[WUZ1_OE:WUZI1]
~z~Break for it, Woozie!

[WUZ1_OG:WUZI1]
~z~Hold up, Woozie, we still got trouble!

[WUZ1_OH:WUZI1]
~z~Lay low!

[WUZ1_OJ:WUZI1]
~z~Woozie, keep it down, we still got trouble!

[WUZ1_OK:WUZI1]
~z~In the car, quick!

[WUZ1_OL:WUZI1]
~z~Get on the back of the bike!

[WUZ1_OM:WUZI1]
~z~On the bike, quick!

[WUZ1_ON:WUZI1]
~z~Let's get the fuck out of here!

[WUZ1_OO:WUZI1]
~z~Let's get the hell out of here!

[WUZ1_OP:WUZI1]
~z~We got more company!

[WUZ1_OQ:WUZI1]
~z~Cars on our tail!

[WUZ1_OR:WUZI1]
~z~More of them, in cars!

[WUZ1_PA:WUZI1]
~z~You drive, I'll send them back to the sewers!

[WUZ1_PB:WUZI1]
~z~Keep driving, I'll take care of these murderous scum!

[WUZ1_QA:WUZI1]
~z~That look like the last of 'em.

[WUZ1_QB:WUZI1]
~z~OK, let's get back to my place.

[WUZ1_QC:WUZI1]
~z~This is a black day for the Red Gecko Tong.

[WUZ1_QD:WUZI1]
~z~We've lost a Triad to interlopers.

[WUZ1_QE:WUZI1]
~z~The Mountain Cloud Boys will not rest until the Blood Feathers are avenged.

[WUZ1_QF:WUZI1]
~z~Another day, Woozie, another day.

[WUZ1_QG:WUZI1]
~z~Yes.

[WUZ1_QH:WUZI1]
~z~First we must mourn and make funerary arrangements.

[WUZ1_RA:WUZI1]
~z~Thank you, Carl, you saved me from having to kill them all myself.

[WUZ1_RB:WUZI1]
~z~Yeah, well. Give me a call if you need some more help, man.

[WUZ1_RC:WUZI1]
~z~Sure thing.

[WUZ1_RD:WUZI1]
~z~Here, a token of the Tong's appreciation for what you did today.

[WOO1@32:WUZI1]
~z~Stupid ass motherfucker...

[WOO1@33:WUZI1]
~z~Yes, right this way.

{=================================== MISSION TABLE WUZI2 ===================================}

[WOO2@00:WUZI2]
~z~Hold on. You tryin' to tell me you can't swim?

[WOO2@01:WUZI2]
~z~Seriously, when I'm in the deep water, it panics me,

[WOO2@02:WUZI2]
~z~plus, I'm terrified of eels, and squid, and seaweed, and...

[WOO2@03:WUZI2]
~z~OK dude, see - I know you just trying to make excuses now!

[WOO2@04:WUZI2]
~z~Look, CJ, I need someone from outside the Triad who I can trust.

[WOO2@05:WUZI2]
~z~A'ight, so let me get this straight.

[WOO2@06:WUZI2]
~z~You want me to swim around in dirty dock water,

[WOO2@07:WUZI2]
~z~dodging little brown jelly beans and Vietnamese gangsters,

[WOO2@08:WUZI2]
~z~to put a bug on a boat in the harbor?

[WOO2@09:WUZI2]
~z~You're so negative!

[WOO2@10:WUZI2]
~z~Listen, man - when I was a kid, swimming off the Santa Maria,

[WOO2@11:WUZI2]
~z~I once got a condom stuck to my face.

[WOO2@12:WUZI2]
~z~Horror like that stays with you for life, believe that.

[WOO2@13:WUZI2]
~z~I have a confession to make...

[WOO2@14:WUZI2]
~z~I... I'm blind.

[WOO2@15:WUZI2]
~z~No shit!

[WOO2@16:WUZI2]
~z~Yes, although I've trained my other senses to a point

[WOO2@17:WUZI2]
~z~where you wouldn't notice my handicap,

[WOO2@18:WUZI2]
~z~in the water they'd be quite useless.

[WOO2@19:WUZI2]
~z~Alright, Woozie, relax. Don't beat yourself up about it.

[WOO2@20:WUZI2]
~z~Look, I'll do it.

[WOO2@21:WUZI2]
~z~Uh, one last thing. You do know that I'm black, right? And not Chinese.

[WOO2@22:WUZI2]
~z~I'm blind, Carl, not stupid.

[W2ALT00:WUZI2]
~z~I need something taken care of.

[W2ALT01:WUZI2]
~z~What? Hey, man, quit trying to distract me!

[W2ALT02:WUZI2]
~z~How are you in the water?

[W2ALT03:WUZI2]
~z~What you mean, can I swim?

[W2ALT04:WUZI2]
~z~Yeah. Can you swim well?

[W2ALT05:WUZI2]
~z~No, I can't!

[W2ALT06:WUZI2]
~z~SHIT! Man, damn!

[W2ALT07:WUZI2]
~z~How you do that?!!

[W2ALT08:WUZI2]
~z~Shit! Damn!

[WUZ2_AA:WUZI2]
~z~I think I see something in the water!

[WUZ2_AB:WUZI2]
~z~Hey, what was that? Over there!

[WUZ2_AC:WUZI2]
~z~Anybody else see that?

[WUZ2_BA:WUZI2]
~z~Gotta stop spooking myself!

[WUZ2_BB:WUZI2]
~z~Must have been a seal or something...

[WUZ2_BC:WUZI2]
~z~My mind must be playing tricks.

[WUZ2_CA:WUZI2]
~z~Shit, over there! Some guy in the water!

[WUZ2_CB:WUZI2]
~z~There, a man in the water!

[WUZ2_CC:WUZI2]
~z~We got somebody in the water over here!

[WUZ2_DA:WUZI2]
~z~Where'd he go?

[WUZ2_DB:WUZI2]
~z~He's gone under!

[WUZ2_DC:WUZI2]
~z~He was just here!

[WUZ2_EA:WUZI2]
~z~Shit, must have been a seal...

[WUZ2_EB:WUZI2]
~z~Man, he must have drowned by now!

[WUZ2_EC:WUZI2]
~z~No, he's long gone or dead.

[WUZ2_FA:WUZI2]
~z~There he is again!

[WUZ2_FB:WUZI2]

[WUZ2_HB:WUZI2]
~z~Hey!

[WUZ2_HC:WUZI2]
~z~What the fuck?

[WUZ2_JA:WUZI2]
~z~Must be hearing things...

[WUZ2_JB:WUZI2]
~z~Nah, I don't know what it was...

[WUZ2_JC:WUZI2]
~z~Nothing, gotta stop freaking out...

[WUZ2_KA:WUZI2]
~z~Shit, who's that?

[WUZ2_KB:WUZI2]
~z~Hey you!

[WUZ2_KC:WUZI2]
~z~Who the fuck are you?

[WUZ2_LA:WUZI2]
~z~Damn, lost him!

[WUZ2_LB:WUZI2]
~z~I lost him, keep your eyes open!

[WUZ2_LC:WUZI2]
~z~Damn, gave me the slip!

[WUZ2_MA:WUZI2]

~z~Hey, someone in the water!

[WUZ2_NB:WUZI2]
~z~See that? Over there!

[WUZ2_NC:WUZI2]
~z~We got a swimmer approaching the boat!

[WUZ2_OA:WUZI2]
~z~Nah, I must be tripping or something.

[WUZ2_OB:WUZI2]
~z~Shit, could have sworn I saw something!

[WUZ2_OC:WUZI2]
~z~Man, I swear I saw something...

[WUZ2_PA:WUZI2]
~z~There he is!

[WUZ2_PB:WUZI2]
~z~I see him!

[WUZ2_PC:WUZI2]
~z~There's the bastard!

[WUZ2_QA:WUZI2]
~z~He's gone under!

[WUZ2_QB:WUZI2]
~z~He's dived again!

[WUZ2_QC:WUZI2]
~z~He's under us!

[WUZ2_RA:WUZI2]
~z~No one can hold their breath that long, man!

[WUZ2_RB:WUZI2]
~z~He must be dead...

[WUZ2_RC:WUZI2]
~z~Shit he's been down there too long!

[WUZ2_SA:WUZI2]
~z~There he is again!

[WUZ2_SB:WUZI2]

[WUZ2_ZN:WUZI2]
~z~We must have winged him!

[WUZ2_ZO:WUZI2]
~z~We must have killed him!

[WUZ2_ZP:WUZI2]
~z~He must have got trapped down there!

[WUZ2_ZQ:WUZI2]

~z~CJ, you caught me on my way out.

[WOO4@02:WUZI4]
~z~Business?

[WOO4@03:WUZI4]
~z~This is the big one,

[WOO4@04:WUZI4]
~z~this is the one that is going to seal my place in the Red Gecko Tong.

~z~Your help and friendship has been invaluable to me.

[WOO4@16:WUZI4]
~z~Thanks man. Where the other guys?

[WOO4@17:WUZI4]
~z~Oh, they're getting a helicopter

[WOO4@18:WUZI4]
~z~to do a couple of flybys of the ship.

[WOO4@19:WUZI4]
~z~Look - if everything goes well,

[WOO4@20:WUZI4]
~z~I'll call you in a week or so and invite you to my new spot.

[WUZ4_AA:WUZI4]

~z~Strap in and strap up!

[WUZ4_LA:WUZI4]

[WUZ4_NA:WUZI4]
~z~RPG! RPG!

[WUZ4_NB:WUZI4]
~z~Where? Which side?

[WUZ4_NC:WUZI4]
~z~We're hit!

[WUZ4_ND:WUZI4]
~z~(Sirens, whines, clattering gears etc.)

[WUZ4_NE:WUZI4]
~z~We're going down!

[WUZ4_NF:WUZI4]
~z~Brace for impact!

[WUZ4_OA:WUZI4]
~z~Oh man, that hurt!

[WUZ4_OB:WUZI4]

{=================================== MISSION TABLE ZERO1 ===================================}

[ZER1@00:ZERO1]
~z~Hey, whattup, Zee?

[ZER1@01:ZERO1]
~z~Nothing is up, Carl, apart from my blood pressure,

[ZER1@02:ZERO1]
~z~and the imminent collapse of my hopes and dreams.

[ZER1@03:ZERO1]
~z~Why?

[ZER1@04:ZERO1]
~z~As usual, the forces of darkness have triumphed over good.

[ZER1@05:ZERO1]
~z~Life is nothing but misery, briefly interspersed with agony.

[ZER1@06:ZERO1]
~z~Homie, what you on? Whatever it is, you need to reduce the dosage.

[ZER1@07:ZERO1]
~z~Excuse me, but I never take drugs.

[ZER1@08:ZERO1]
~z~We all know drugs are for losers, and/or sex maniacs.

[ZER1@09:ZERO1]
~z~And right now, sex is the last thing on my mind.

[ZER1@10:ZERO1]
~z~Thank God for that!

[ZER1@11:ZERO1]
~z~Berkley is back!

[ZER1@12:ZERO1]
~z~Ooohhh. Berkley.

[ZER1@13:ZERO1]
~z~Just a man I once beat in fair competition.

[ZER1@14:ZERO1]
~z~A man literally obsessed with revenge.

[ZER1@15:ZERO1]
~z~Oh, you put hands on him?

[ZER1@16:ZERO1]
~z~No, please. I never initiate violence.

[ZER1@17:ZERO1]
~z~Oh, I know - you knocked his bitch!

[ZER1@18:ZERO1]
~z~No. I won the prize in the science fair. First prize, that is.

[ZER1@19:ZERO1]
~z~And now he wanna pop you?

[ZER1@20:ZERO1]
~z~And they say gang bangers is petty and small minded!

[ZER1@21:ZERO1]
~z~Hey, what's that bleeping sound?

[ZER1@22:ZERO1]
~z~That's him! We shall fight to the end!

[ZER1_AA:ZERO1]
~z~Berkley's launched a full-scale attack!

[ZER1_AB:ZERO1]
~z~This is insanity!

[ZER1_AC:ZERO1]
~z~All batteries commence fire!

[ZER1_AD:ZERO1]
~z~No problem man, but they only toys.

[ZER1_AE:ZERO1]
~z~They're not toys! They're just smaller!

[ZER1_BA:ZERO1]
~z~He's going for my transmitters!

[ZER1_BB:ZERO1]
~z~If he takes them out, I'll never be able to launch a counter attack!

[ZER1_BC:ZERO1]
~z~Kamikazes at 6 o'clock!

[ZER1_BD:ZERO1]
~z~RC Barons at 9 o'clock high, Carl!

[ZER1_BE:ZERO1]
~z~CJ, bogies at 12 o'clock!

[ZER1_BF:ZERO1]
~z~Squadron at 3 o'clock, Carl!

[ZER1_BG:ZERO1]
~z~We've lost a transmitter!

[ZER1_BH:ZERO1]
~z~Another transmitters ruined!

[ZER1_BJ:ZERO1]
~z~Another blow to our war effort!

[ZER1_BK:ZERO1]
~z~We can't lose another transmitter!

[ZER1_BL:ZERO1]
~z~Berkley's going for the last transmitter,

[ZER1_BM:ZERO1]
~z~you've got to stop those planes, Carl!

[ZER1_BN:ZERO1]
~z~I thought you said you could shoot, Carl!

[ZER1_CA:ZERO1]
~z~Great, kid, don't get cocky!

[ZER1_DA:ZERO1]
~z~Hey, hey, hey! FRIENDLY FIRE! FRIENDLY FIRE!

[ZER1_EA:ZERO1]
~z~Curse you, Berkley, CURSE YOOUUU!

[ZER1_EB:ZERO1]
~z~NOOOOOOOOOooooooooooo!

[ZER1_EC:ZERO1]
~z~My humiliation is complete!

[ZER1_FA:ZERO1]
~z~Ha ha ha ha Berkley!

[ZER1_FB:ZERO1]
~z~As long as we have opposable thumbs, WE WILL FIGHT YOU!

[ZER1_FC:ZERO1]
~z~...Well done, Carl.

[ZER1_FD:ZERO1]
~z~Now leave, I must prepare for the battles ahead!

[ZER1_FE:ZERO1]
~z~Never have so few owed so many...

[ZER1_FF:ZERO1]
~z~We will fight him on the beaches, well, rooftops...

[ZER1_FG:ZERO1]
~z~too little, three.. no that's not it, what is it?

[ZER1@23:ZERO1]
~z~Yes.

[ZER1@24:ZERO1]
~z~Who the fuck is Berkley?

{=================================== MISSION TABLE ZERO2 ===================================}

[ZER2@00:ZERO2]
~z~Hey, Zee, where you at?

[ZER2@01:ZERO2]
~z~Go away, Carl. I'm very, very, busy back here. Top secret stuff. Not for your eyes. Too sensitive...

[ZER2@02:ZERO2]
~z~Come on, homie, where are you?

[ZER2@03:ZERO2]
~z~I said go away, Carl. I don't need any friends today, thank you.

[ZER2@04:ZERO2]
~z~Man, them some pretty strong drawers!

[ZER2@05:ZERO2]
~z~Yes, my hero. Carl, he came back and humiliated me!

[ZER2@06:ZERO2]
~z~I shall probably turn to prostitution now,

[ZER2@07:ZERO2]
~z~where I will be found dead, and broken.

[ZER2@08:ZERO2]
~z~I am a 28 year old man,

[ZER2@09:ZERO2]
~z~whose landlord just helped him down from a hook,

[ZER2@10:ZERO2]
~z~from which I had been hanging from my underwear,

[ZER2@11:ZERO2]
~z~contemplating my inadequacy, for nearly two hours.

[ZER2@12:ZERO2]
~z~Look, you gotta get even, homie.

[ZER2@13:ZERO2]
~z~What kind of weapons you got?

[ZER2@14:ZERO2]
~z~Uhh... I've got a prototype of a miniature plane.

[ZER2@15:ZERO2]
~z~Well with that plane, we gonna go humiliate Berkley.

[ZER2_AA:ZERO2]
~z~Launch the Red Baron!

[ZER2_AB:ZERO2]
~z~Berkley has his sycophantic lackeys do all his deliveries.

[ZER2_AC:ZERO2]
~z~Well, we shall hit him where it hurts the most!

[ZER2_AD:ZERO2]
~z~Bring his mail order model business to its knees!

[ZER2_BA:ZERO2]
~z~Don't let him get away, punish him for his war crimes!

[ZER2_BB:ZERO2]
~z~He's armed his lieutenants, be careful, Carl!

[ZER2_CA:ZERO2]
~z~One down, four to go!

[ZER2_CB:ZERO2]
~z~That's two Berkley, TWO!

[ZER2_CC:ZERO2]
~z~Ha ha, only three delivery boys left!

[ZER2_CD:ZERO2]
~z~Only two left now, Carl - HUNT THEM DOWN!

[ZER2_CE:ZERO2]
~z~Just one more and Berkley's mail order department is finished!

[ZER2_DA:ZERO2]
~z~Watch your fuel, Carl, only half a tank left!

[ZER2_DB:ZERO2]
~z~You're nearly out of fuel, hurry up!

[ZER2_DC:ZERO2]
~z~Watch your battery, Carl. Only half the charge is left!

[ZER2_DD:ZERO2]
~z~You're battery's nearly flat, hurry up!

[ZER2_EA:ZERO2]
~z~Well done, Carl!

[ZER2_EB:ZERO2]
~z~Now get her back home in one piece, before she runs out of fuel!

[ZER2_EC:ZERO2]
~z~Now get her back home in one piece, before her battery runs flat!

[ZER2_FA:ZERO2]
~z~Smell it! You know that two-stroke smell,

[ZER2_FB:ZERO2]
~z~The smell, you know that ozone smell,

[ZER1_FH:ZERO2]
~z~Fight or die Carl, it's the only choice we have.

[ZER2_FC:ZERO2]
~z~smells like... victory!

[ZER2@17:ZERO2]
~z~Ow! Ooh, my crack...

[ZER2@18:ZERO2]
~z~OK, cool!

[ZER2@19:ZERO2]
~z~Man, this is ridiculous.

[ZER2@20:ZERO2]
~z~That went right up my crack...

[ZER2_FD:ZERO2]
~z~smells like... victory!

{=================================== MISSION TABLE ZERO3 ===================================}

[ZER3@00:ZERO3]
~z~What's wrong with you now?

[ZER3@01:ZERO3]
~z~I've learned an important lesson.

[ZER3@02:ZERO3]
~z~What?

[ZER3@03:ZERO3]
~z~That it's fun to have an enemy.

[ZER3@04:ZERO3]
~z~That with Berkley dead my life is also over.

[ZER3@05:ZERO3]
~z~What do you mean?

[ZER3@06:ZERO3]
~z~It is perfectly natural, Carl.

[ZER3@07:ZERO3]
~z~We're fighting machines, Carl, as much as this tank, or that chopper.

[ZER3@08:ZERO3]
~z~And with no one to fight, we're nothing.

[ZER3@09:ZERO3]
~z~I am just facing up to the void.

[ZER3@10:ZERO3]
~z~Don't mind me, Carl. I am having an existential crisis.

[ZER3@11:ZERO3]
~z~You carry on painting graffiti and wearing your gold chains.

[ZER3@12:ZERO3]
~z~All I want is a little peace.

[ZER3@13:ZERO3]
~z~I got the cops on my case,

[ZER3@14:ZERO3]
~z~a big fat prick who betrayed me and you're having such a crisis?

[ZER3@15:ZERO3]
~z~Man, I'll give you 'exi-mental', you damn square.

[ZER3@16:ZERO3]
~z~What's that noise?

[ZER3@17:ZERO3]
~z~Sounds like a model 7, a 5:1 ratio, equipped with cannon.

[ZER3@18:ZERO3]
~z~No, it doesn't. No it doesn't...

[ZER3@19:ZERO3]
~z~It sounds like a whole army of them!

[ZER3@20:ZERO3]
~z~Oh dear God - Berkley is alive?

[ZER3_AA:ZERO3]
~z~Whoa, dude, a tiny war machine!

[ZER3_AB:ZERO3]
~z~Hey, is that, like for real?

[ZER3_AC:ZERO3]
~z~Oh man, ain't it cute!

[ZER3_AD:ZERO3]
~z~Holy Gaia! It's a bad trip Satan toy!

[ZER3_AE:ZERO3]
~z~Mother of God! It's blasting!

[ZER3_AF:ZERO3]
~z~Fucking shit! It's packing!

[ZER3_ZA:ZERO3]
~z~Hey, a cute toy tank!

[ZER3_ZB:ZERO3]
~z~Make love toys, not war toys!

[ZER3_ZC:ZERO3]
~z~Oh man, I've always wanted one of these!

[ZER3_ZD:ZERO3]
~z~One serious fucking toy!

[ZER3_ZE:ZERO3]
~z~That toy's got real attitude problems!

[ZER3_ZF:ZERO3]
~z~It's a tiny soviet invasion!

[ZER3_BA:ZERO3]
~z~It must have been a patrol we heard.

[ZER3_BB:ZERO3]
~z~If Berkley's still alive, he'll be servicing his transmitters!

[ZER3_BC:ZERO3]
~z~We've got to go stop him!

[ZER3_BD:ZERO3]
~z~How?

[ZER3_BE:ZERO3]
~z~You're the gangster, you tell me!

[ZER3_DA:ZERO3]
~z~Carl, where are you going?

[ZER3_DB:ZERO3]
~z~What are you doing, Carl?

[ZER3_EA:ZERO3]
~z~That's Berkley over there!

[ZER3_EB:ZERO3]
~z~Right, I'm going to go beat on that fool!

[ZER3_EC:ZERO3]
~z~Wait!

[ZER3_ED:ZERO3]
~z~Berkley is a master tactician, a cautious general!

[ZER3_EE:ZERO3]
~z~Meaning?

[ZER3_EF:ZERO3]
~z~Meaning it's a trap!

[ZER3_EG:ZERO3]
~z~Deploy the tank!

[ZER3_FA:ZERO3]
~z~Use the tank to take out those buggies!

[ZER3_FB:ZERO3]
~z~What's the problem, they're only little cars?

[ZER3_FC:ZERO3]
~z~Trust me, stop them at all costs!

[ZER3_GA:ZERO3]
~z~Holy fuck!

[ZER3_GB:ZERO3]
~z~See, Berkley isn't a kid and these things aren't toys!

[ZER3_HA:ZERO3]
~z~Ohmygod! Stop those buggies, Carl!

[ZER3_HB:ZERO3]
~z~Shit, Carl, what are you doing?

[ZER3_HC:ZERO3]
~z~We going to die, I know it!

[ZER3_HD:ZERO3]
~z~Curse you, Berkley, Curse you!

[ZER3_HE:ZERO3]
~z~Ow, that really hurt!

[ZER3_HF:ZERO3]
~z~We can't take much more!

[ZER3_HG:ZERO3]
~z~One more hit and Berkley's won!

[ZER3_JA:ZERO3]
~z~Man, you guys play hard!

[ZER3_JB:ZERO3]
~z~I told you, Carl, this is war, just on a tiny scale!

[ZER3_JC:ZERO3]
~z~I've got a LOT of work to do!

{=================================== MISSION TABLE ZERO4 ===================================}

[ZER4@00:ZERO4]
~z~What's happening, Zero?

[ZER4@01:ZERO4]
~z~I'm off to engage with destiny, good or bad.

[ZER4@02:ZERO4]
~z~What the hell are you talking about now?

[ZER4@03:ZERO4]
~z~The hour of judgment is upon me

[ZER4@04:ZERO4]
~z~and I must ask myself if I am a sheep or a goat.

[ZER4@05:ZERO4]
~z~Carl, will you be my second?

[ZER4@06:ZERO4]
~z~Here are some letters.

[ZER4@07:ZERO4]
~z~I have left everything to you in case I don't make it. Please.

[ZER4@08:ZERO4]
~z~I already own it. What's wrong with you, man?

[ZER4@09:ZERO4]
~z~We are crossing the Rubicon.

[ZER4@10:ZERO4]
~z~I am to engage in battle with Berkley.

[ZER4@11:ZERO4]
~z~At stake, honor and our very lives.

[ZER4@12:ZERO4]
~z~It's funny... I've never noticed before

[ZER4@13:ZERO4]
~z~how beautiful this time of year can be...

[ZER4@14:ZERO4]
~z~I may never again see Rome in the springtime.

[ZER4@15:ZERO4]
~z~C'mon with all the talking, man - is you going to battle Berkley or what?

[ZER4@16:ZERO4]
~z~It's a fight to the death! Come hither!

[ZER4_AA:ZERO4]
~z~Behold, No Man's Land!

[ZER4_AB:ZERO4]
~z~Man, y'all take this shit seriously.

[ZER4_AC:ZERO4]
~z~Berkley's HQ is across No Man's Land.

[ZER4_AD:ZERO4]
~z~I'll drive the Bandit, you fly the Goblin and help any way you can!

[ZER4_AE:ZERO4]
~z~If I get the Bandit into Berkley's base, he must leave San Fierro for good!

[ZER4_AF:ZERO4]
~z~LET BATTLE COMMENCE!

[ZER4_BA:ZERO4]
~z~Berkley's trying to stop my progress with obstacles!

[ZER4_BB:ZERO4]
~z~Curse you and your blocking tactics, Berkley!

[ZER4_BC:ZERO4]
~z~My way is blocked! All will be lost!

[ZER4_CA:ZERO4]
~z~Carl, don't be an idiot, use the Goblin to move that barrel!

[ZER4_CB:ZERO4]
~z~Move the barrel with the Goblin's magnet, Carl!

[ZER4_CC:ZERO4]
~z~Use the Goblin to remove the obstacle!

[ZER4_DA:ZERO4]
~z~Carl, move that obstruction!

[ZER4_DB:ZERO4]
~z~Carl, I'm blocked!

[ZER4_DC:ZERO4]
~z~There's another cursed barrel in the way!

[ZER4_DD:ZERO4]
~z~Move it, Carl, Berkley's blocked me again!

[ZER4_DE:ZERO4]
~z~Curse you, Berkley! Carl, move that barrel!

[ZER4_EA:ZERO4]
~z~Berkley's using tanks!

[ZER4_EB:ZERO4]
~z~Carl, grab a bomb and get rid of any tanks that threaten our progress!

[ZER4_FA:ZERO4]
~z~I'm taking hits, Carl, bomb Berkley's tanks!

[ZER4_FB:ZERO4]
~z~Bomb that tank, Carl!

[ZER4_FC:ZERO4]
~z~Carl, Berkley's tanks are tearing the Bandit to pieces!

[ZER4_FD:ZERO4]
~z~Argh! Where's my backup, Carl!

[ZER4_FE:ZERO4]
~z~Protect the Bandit, Carl, it's getting shot up!

[ZER4_FF:ZERO4]
~z~Bomb those tanks! Bomb them, Carl!

[ZER4_GA:ZERO4]
~z~Get a plank from our base and make a bridge across that gap!

[ZER4_HA:ZERO4]
~z~Carl, I need a bridge, now!

[ZER4_HB:ZERO4]
~z~Get me a plank to cross that river!

[ZER4_HC:ZERO4]
